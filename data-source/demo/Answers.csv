<p>I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:</p>

<p>(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)</p>

<pre><code>//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]<br>colors = []; //holds final colors to be used<br>rand = new Random();<br><br>//assumes n is less than 16,777,216<br>randomGen(int n){<br>   while (len(colors) &lt; n){<br>      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color<br>      newRed = rand.next(256);<br>      newGreen = rand.next(256);<br>      newBlue = rand.next(256);<br>      temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];<br>      //only adds new colors to the array<br>      if temp not in colors {<br>         colors.append(temp);<br>      }<br>   }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:</p>

<pre><code>for item in color{<br>   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   dist = itemSq - tempSq;<br>   dist = abs(dist);<br>}<br>//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.<br>if dist &lt; NUMBER and temp not in colors {<br>   colors.append(temp);<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.</p>

<p>Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example.</p>"
269,91,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z,260,4,"<p>Yes, I thought about that, but I soon figured out that another Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) would be a bit too much.</p>

<p>Essentially, they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule ""When this cards enter play, all your undead minions gain +3 attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed"". As trading card games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the card needs.</p>

<p>If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.</p>

<p>That's why I wanted to stay with a ""real"" .NET language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way (within the limits of the code access security).</p>

332,59,2008-08-02T03:00:24Z,330,19,"<p>I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.</p>

<p>My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.</p>

<p>I would reference something like a <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextdocument.html"">QTextDocument</a> in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.</p>

<p>If you really want to compile at run-time you could use the CodeDOM, then you could use reflection to load the dynamic assembly. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.csharp.csharpcodeprovider.aspx"">MSDN article which might help</a>.</p>"

<p>If you need to connect to a web services that is <em>unknown</em> at compile time, then you would want a more dynamic approach, where you deduce the 'shape' of the web service. </p>

<p>Like if you use Dillie-Os idea you need to mix the colors as much as possible.

<p>Does this make sense?</p>"
539,157,2008-08-02T19:03:52Z,180,21,"<p>My first thought on this is ""how generate N vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other."" You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/RandomPointPicking.html"">Random Point Picking</a>. Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say:</p>

<p>n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/561/using-combinations-of-sets-as-test-data#794"">buckles algorithm 515</a> to find the lexicographically indexed color.<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEuCs.gif"" alt=""\frac {\binom {256^3} {3}} {n} * i"">.

591,111,2008-08-03T00:37:03Z,580,3,"<p>I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control.  In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).</li>
<li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li>
<li>Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB.</p>"
597,76,2008-08-03T01:38:02Z,580,1,"<p>I agree that scripting everything is the best way to go and is what I advocate at work.  You should script everything from DB and object creation to populating your lookup tables.</p>

<p>Anything you do in UI only won't translate (especially for changes... not so much for first deployments) and will end up requiring a tools like what Redgate offers.</p>"

<p>THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. </p>

<p>Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated.</p>

<p>The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them.

<LI>If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.</LI>
<LI>Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).</LI>

  <p>In ASP.NET 2.0, ViewState is saved by
  a descendant of PageStatePersister
  class. This class is an abstract class
  for saving and loading ViewsState and
  there are two implemented descendants
  of this class in .Net Framework, named
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister and
  SessionPageStatePersister. By default
  HiddenFieldPageStatePersister is used
  to save/load ViewState information,
  but we can easily get the
  SessionPageStatePersister to work and
  save ViewState in Session object.</p>

The reason is simple: If you don't do it in the setter, you have to remember that 1 to 100 limitation every time you set it, which leads to duplicated code or when you forget it, it leads to an invalid state.</p>

<P>In order for the CONTAINSTABLE function to know that I'm using a wildcard search, I have to wrap it in double quotes. I can use the wildcard character * at the beginning or ending. There are a lot of other things you can do when you're building the search string for the CONTAINSTABLE function. You can search for a word near another word, search for inflectional words (drive = drives, drove, driving, and driven), and search for synonym of another word (metal can have synonyms such as aluminum and steel).</P>

<P>[Update]</P>
<P>I see that you've updated your question and know that you need to use one of the functions.</P>
<P>You can still search with the wildcard at the beginning, but if the word is not a full word following the wildcard, you have to add another wildcard at the end.</P>Example:  ""*ildcar"" will look for a single word as long as it ends with ""ildcar"".<BR><BR>Example:  ""*ildcar*"" will look for a single word with ""ildcar"" in the middle, which means it will match ""wildcard"".

<p>Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>

<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work.</p>"

<p>The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients.

<p>If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot.</p>

5607,581,2008-08-08T03:04:29Z,5600,31,"<p>When dealing with indexes, you have to determine what your table is going to be used for.  If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.</p>

<p>As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html</a>.</p>

<p>As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.</p>

<p>[Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.</p>
  
  <p>Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.</p>
  
  <p>If you even <em>think</em> you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.</p>
  
  <p>Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by <em>this</em> server, but all values generated by <em>all</em> computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. </p>

When you attempt to do the same, you get the checksum problem you have. If you now make copies of your changed files, do a fresh checkout, then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in.</p>

<p>If you didn't get the problem in this case, when you got around to checkin in your modifications, you would need to update your working copy first, and possibly handle a conflict with your file.</p>

<p>However, if you do a fresh checkout, complete with your collegues changes, it now looks like you removed his changes and substituted with your own. No conflicts, and no indications from subversion that something is amiss.</p>"

If you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues, but you don't care about the order the work within the loop finishes, then calling Join is the answer.

<pre><code>// Start all of the threads.
List&lt;Thread&gt; startedThreads = new List&lt;Thread&gt;();
foreach (...) {

foreach (Thread thread in startedThreads) {

<p>In contrast, if you called Join inside the loop, the result would basically be the same as not using threads at all. Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish.</p>

<p>If the individual threads produce some result (write a message in a log, for example) then the messages may still appear out of order because there's no coordination between the threads. It is possible to get the threads to output their results in order by coordinating them with a Monitor.</p>

<li>Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff.</li>
<li>The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI.</li>

<p>All of these are suitable for both text and binary, though none have a specific readline functionality. What you'd most likely do instead in that case is use the fstream classes (fstream.h) and use the stream operators (&lt;&lt; and >>) or the read function to read/write blocks of text:</p>

<pre><code>int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
myfile.open(""&lt;path to file&gt;"");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
myfile.close();

<p>The problem with a classic example is that you are forced to close the file by yourself, meaning that you will have to bend your architecture to this need. RAII makes use of the automatic destructor call in C++ to close the file for you.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: seems that std::fstream already implements RAII so the code below is useless. I'll keep it here for posterity and as an example of RAII. </p>

<pre><code>class FileOpener
{
public:
    FileOpener(std::fstream&amp; file, const char* fileName): m_file(file)
    { 
        m_file.open(fileName); 
    }
    ~FileOpeneer()
    { 
        file.close(); 
    }

private:
    std::fstream&amp; m_file;
};

ifstream myfile;
FileOpener opener(myfile, ""&lt;path to file&gt;"");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);

If you don't have perpetual access (ie, you sign off on the code and it becomes someone else's responsibility), it's probably best to be as standards-compliant as possible to minimize maintenance headaches later... even if you never have to deal with the code again, your reputation persists and can be transmitted to other potential clients, and many teams like to blame the previous developer(s) for problems that come up.</p>

There's a lot of different linq providers for specific types of data- for example, there's linq to xml, linq to entities, even linq to sharepoint. </p>

<p>To get started with linq, in all its many forms, I suggest the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1590597893"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Cocoa Programming for Mac OSX"">Pro Linq by Joseph C. Rattz.</a> It's an excellent overview of Linq.

</ol>

<p>You could also make a base class the writer must inherit. This will make wiring up the API easier. Then use some kind of reflection to scan a directory, and load the classes you find that matches your requirements.  </p>

8157,872,2008-08-11T20:00:09Z,8140,3,"<p>This is generally something thatÂ you'll have to expose yourself, so yes, it will be dependent on the language your system is written in (though often it's possible to write wrappers for other languages as well).</p>

<p>If, for example, you had a program written in C, for Windows, plugins would be written for your program as DLLs.  At runtime, you would manually load these DLLs, and expose some interface to them.  For example, the DLLs might expose a <code>gimme_the_interface()</code> function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers.  These function pointers would allow the DLL to make calls, register callbacks, etc.</p>

<p>If you were in C++, you would use the DLL system, except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct, and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality (accomplishing the same thing as the struct, but less ugly).  For Java, you would load class files on-demand instead of DLLs, but the basic idea would be the same.</p>

<p>In all cases, you'll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins, so that you can initialize the plugins, and so the plugins can interact with you.</p>

<p>P.S. If you'd like to see a good example of a C++ plugin system, check out the <a href=""http://foobar2000.com/SDK.html"" rel=""nofollow"">foobar2000 SDK</a>.  I haven't used it in quite a while, but it used to be really well done.  I assume it still is.</p>

<p>what makes sense to do is to identify the pieces of your system that can be meaningfully extended and support a proper API for these cases (e.g. language support plug-ins in an editor). You'd use the relevant patterns, but the specific implementation depends on your platform/language choice.</p>

<p>If you are using C++, check out the boost python library.  Otherwise, python ships with headers that can be used in C, and does a fairly good job documenting the C/python API.

</blockquote>

<p>The UI asks the ServiceClass in the business tier for a service, namely getting a list of objects filtered by an object with the needed parameter data.<br />
Then the ServiceClass creates an instance of one of the repository classes in the data tier, and calls the GetList(ParameterType filters).<br />
Then the data tier accesses the database, pulls up the data, and maps it to the common format defined in the ""domain"" assembly.<br />
The BL has no more work to do with this data, so it outputs it to the UI.</p>

<p>Then the UI wants to edit Item X. It sends the item (or business object) to the service in the Business Tier. The business tier validates the object, and if it is OK, it sends it to the data tier for storage.</p>

<p>The UI knows the service in the business tier which again knows about the data tier.</p>

If I'm understanding your problem correctly, it sounds like you're trying to satisfy too much with a single interface, and that's just causing it to become cluttered.  Why not have two interfaces into the business layer?  One would be a simple, safe interface for the UI layer.  The other would be a lower-level interface for the data layer.</p>

<p>You can apply this two-interface approach to any objects which need to be passed to both the UI and the data layers, too.</p>

<p>It is possible to inherit and implement both set of interfaces such that:</p>

<p>This way, in your data layer you only need to see the interface implementation of IData, while in your UI you only need to see the interface implementation of IView.</p>

<pre><code>public class BusinessObject : DomainObject

public class ViewManager&lt;T&gt; where T : DomainObject

9413,184,2008-08-13T02:22:24Z,9410,449,"<p><strong>Declaration</strong></p>

<p>A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>void func ( void (*f)(int) );
</code></pre>

<p>This states that the parameter <code>f</code> will be a pointer to a function which has a <code>void</code> return type and which takes a single <code>int</code> parameter. The following function (<code>print</code>) is an example of a function which could be passed to <code>func</code> as a parameter because it is the proper type:</p>

<pre><code>void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Function Call</strong></p>

<p>When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this:</p>

<pre><code>func(print);
</code></pre>

<p>would call <code>func</code>, passing the print function to it.</p>

<p><strong>Function Body</strong></p>

<p>As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:</p>

<pre><code>for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>func</code>'s parameter declaration says that <code>f</code> is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if <code>f</code> is a pointer then <code>*f</code> is the thing that <code>f</code> points to (i.e. the function <code>print</code> in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with <code>*f</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }
}
</code></pre>

9421,716,2008-08-13T02:34:47Z,9410,81,"<p>This question already has the answer for defining function pointers, however they can get very messy, especially if you are going to be passing them around your application. To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example.</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (*functiontype)();
</code></pre>

<p>Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do:</p>

<pre><code>void dosomething() { }

functiontype func = &amp;dosomething;
func();
</code></pre>

<p>For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would do</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (*functiontype2)(char);
</code></pre>

<p>and to use it</p>

<pre><code>int dosomethingwithchar(char a) { return 1; }

functiontype2 func2 = &amp;dosomethingwithchar
int result = func2('a');
</code></pre>

<p>There are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types. The <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/function.html"">boost function</a> library is great and is well worth the effort!</p>

<pre><code>boost::function&lt;int (char a)&gt; functiontype2;

"
9502,1131,2008-08-13T06:08:24Z,9240,7,"<p>If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.</p>

<p>E.g</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
	private string name;
	private AccountStatus status;

	private User()
	{
	}

	public string Name
	{
		get { return name; }
		set { name = value; }
	}

	public AccountStatus Status
	{
		get { return status; }
	}

	public void Activate()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Active;
	}

	public void Suspend()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
	}

	public static User GetById(int id)
	{
		User fetchedUser = new User();

		// Lots of database and error-checking code
		// omitted for clarity
		// ...

		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];
		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

		return fetchedUser;
	}

	public static void Save(User user)
	{
		// Code to save User's internal structure to database
		// ...
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.</p>

<p>The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++</p>

<p>For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'</p>

<p>However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.</p>

<p>Good question.  If reversing the ""ON"" bits means reversing only the bits that are ""ON"", then you will always get 0, no matter what the input is.  If it means reversing <em>all</em> the bits, i.e. changing all 1s to 0s and all 0s to 1s, which is how I initially read it, then that's just a bitwise NOT, or complement.  C-based languages have a complement operator, <code>~</code>, that does this.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char b = 102;      /* 0x66, 01100110 */
unsigned char reverse = ~b; /* 0x99, 10011001 */

<p>I almost mentioned that, but ended up leaving it out, since calling <code>strcmp()</code> with the empty string and directly checking the first character in the string are both O(1).  You basically just pay for an extra function call, which is pretty cheap.  If you <em>really</em> need the absolute best speed, though, definitely go with a direct first-char-to-0 comparison.</p>

<p>I think many developers think of the database as a simple persistence layer for their objects, and are only concerned with the CRUD operations that those objects need.  Too much effort is being put into the ""impedence mismatch"" between object and relational models.  Here's an idea: stop trying.</p>

<p>Write stored procedures to encapsulate your data.  Use results sets, DataSet, DataTable, SqlCommand (or the java/php/whatever equivalent) as needed from code to interact with the database.  You don't need those objects.  An excellent example is embedding a SqlDataSource into a .ASPX page.</p>

<p>You shouldn't try to hide your data from anyone.  Developers need to understand exactly how and when they are interacting with the physical data store.</p>

<p>Object-relational mappers are the devil.  Stop using them.</p>

<p>Building enterprise applications is often an exercise in managing complexity.  You have to keep things as simple as possible, or you will have an absolutely un-maintainable system.

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two ways to use Automation (or OLE Automation) to
  programmatically control another application.</p>
  
  <p>Late binding uses CreateObject to create and instance of the
  application object, which you can then control. For example, to create
  a new instance of Excel using late binding:</p>

<pre><code> Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = CreateObject(""Excel.Application"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>On the other hand, to manipulate an existing instance of Excel (if
  Excel is already open) you would use GetObject (regardless whether
  you're using early or late binding):</p>

<pre><code> Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = GetObject(, ""Excel.Application"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>To use early binding, you first need to set a reference in your
  project to the application you want to manipulate. In the VB Editor of
  any Office application, or in VB itself, you do this by selecting
  Tools + References, and selecting the application you want from the
  list (e.g. âMicrosoft Excel 8.0 Object Libraryâ).</p>
  
  <p>To create a new instance of Excel using early binding:</p>

<pre><code> Dim oXL As Excel.Application
 Set oXL = New Excel.Application
</code></pre>
  
  <p>In either case, incidentally, you can first try to get an existing
  instance of Excel, and if that returns an error, you can create a new
  instance in your error handler.</p>

"
10582,1190,2008-08-14T02:16:42Z,10580,12,"<p>In compiled languages, the difference is stark.</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>//early binding:
public create_a_foo(*args) {
 return new Foo(args)
}
my_foo = create_a_foo();

//late binding:
public create_something(Class klass, *args) {
  klass.new_instance(args)
}
my_foo = create_something(Foo);
</code></pre>

<p>In the first example, the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time.  In the second, you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly.  (Of course, newer JVMs support the <code>Class&lt;? extends Foo&gt; klass</code> structure, which can greatly reduce this risk.)</p>

<p>Another benefit is that IDEs can hotlink to the class definition, since it's declared right there in the method.  The call to create<em>something(Foo) might be _very</em> far from the method definition, and if you're looking at the method definition, it might be nice to see the implementation.</p>

<p>The major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion-of-control easier, as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck-typing (if your language supports such things).</p>
"
10584,1190,2008-08-14T02:21:56Z,10580,2,"<p>In interpreted languages, the difference is a little more subtle.</p>

# late binding:
def create_something(klass, *args)
  klass.new(*args)

my_foo = create_something(Foo)

<p>Because Ruby is (generally) not compiled, there isn't a compiler to do the nifty up-front stuff.  The growth of JRuby means that more Ruby is compiled these days, though, making it act more like Java, above.</p>

<p>The issue with IDEs still stands: a platform like Eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard-code them, but cannot if you leave them up to the caller.</p>

<p>Inversion-of-control is not terribly popular in Ruby, probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility, but Rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going.</p>

<p>First, see if there is another API call to determine exit status... a quick glance and I don't see one, but I am not well versed in the standard C API.</p>

<p>An easy alternative is to have a global variable that stores the exit status... the default being an unknown error cause (for if the program terminates abnormally).  Then, when you call exit, you can store the exit status in the global and retrieve it from any atexit functions.  This requires storing the exit status diligently before every exit call, and clearly is not ideal, but if there is no API and you don't want to risk <code>on_exit</code> not being on the platform... it might be the only option.</p>

10796,872,2008-08-14T08:09:47Z,10680,1,"<p>@Nathan, I can't find any function that will return the exit code for the current running process.  I expect that it isn't set yet at the point when <code>atexit()</code> is called, anyway.  By this I mean that the runtime knows what it is, but probably hasn't reported it to the OS.  This is pretty much just conjecture, though.</p>

<p>It looks like you will either need to use <code>on_exit()</code> or structure your program so that the exit code doesn't matter.  It would not be unreasonable to have the last statement in your main function flip a global <code>exited_cleanly</code> variable to true.  In the function you register with <code>atexit()</code>, you could check this variable to determine how the program exited.  This will only give you two states, but I expect that would be sufficient for most needs.  You could also expand this type of scheme to support more exit states if necessary.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I do this:</p>

<pre><code>public void GetFoosById(IList&lt;Foo&gt; foos, int id) { ... }

<p>This lets me pass in a plain old List if that's all I need, or a more intelligent implementation of IList&lt;T&gt; (like ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;) if I plan to bind to it from the UI. This technique also lets me return stuff from the method like a ValidationResult containing an error message if one occurred.</p>

<p>Antonio is right; if you need to pass extra parameters, you'll need to redefine your function pointer to accept the additional arguments. If you don't know exactly what parameters you'll need, then you have at least three choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have the last argument in your prototype be a void*. This gives you flexibility of passing in anything else that you need, but it definitely isn't type-safe.</li>
<li>Use variadic parameters (...). Given my lack of experience with variadic parameters in C, I'm not sure if you can use this with a function pointer, but this gives even more flexibility than the first solution, albeit still with the lack of type safety.</li>

I am <em>guessing</em> that .NET contacts some web site which reports it back.  There are a couple ways to go.  First, a deeper look into the ICMP protocol may give you the information you need.  You can also trace the IP you go through (your route).  When you encounter an IP that is not in the following ranges:</p>

<ul>
<li>10.0.0.0 â 10.255.255.255</li>
<li>172.16.0.0 â 172.31.255.255</li>
<li>192.168.0.0 â 192.168.255.255</li>

<p>it is the IP one hop away from yours, and probably shares a few octets of information with your IP.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Try

12210,1117,2008-08-15T12:57:22Z,12140,1,"<p>I like to model my configuration access off of the Service Locator pattern.  This gives me a single point to get any configuration value that I need and by putting it outside the application in a separate library, it allows reuse and testability.  Here is some sample code, I am not sure what language you are using, but I wrote it in C#.</p>

<p>First I create a generic class that will models my ConfigurationItem.</p>

<pre><code>public class ConfigurationItem&lt;T&gt;
{
    private T item;

    public ConfigurationItem(T item)
    {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T GetValue()
    {
        return item;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create a class that exposes public static readonly variables for the configuration item.  Here I am just reading the ConnectionStringSettings from a config file, which is just xml.  Of course for more items, you can read the values from any source.</p>

<pre><code>public class ConfigurationItems
{
    public static ConfigurationItem&lt;ConnectionStringSettings&gt; ConnectionSettings = new ConfigurationItem&lt;ConnectionStringSettings&gt;(RetrieveConnectionString());

    private static ConnectionStringSettings RetrieveConnectionString()
    {
        // In .Net, we store our connection string in the application/web config file.
        // We can access those values through the ConfigurationManager class.
        return ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""ConnectionKey""]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then when I need a ConfigurationItem for use, I call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>ConfigurationItems.ConnectionSettings.GetValue();
</code></pre>

<p>And it will return me a type safe value, which I can then cache or do whatever I want with.</p>

<p>Here's a sample test:</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class ConfigurationItemsTest
{
    [Test]
    public void ShouldBeAbleToAccessConnectionStringSettings()
    {
        ConnectionStringSettings item = ConfigurationItems.ConnectionSettings.GetValue();
        Assert.IsNotNull(item);
    }
}

<p>Another possibility is a ""materialized view"" (or as they call it in DB2), which lets you specify a table that is essentially built of parts from multiple tables.  Thus, rather than normalizing the actual columns, you could provide this view to access the data... but I don't know if this has severe performance impacts on inserts/updates/deletes (but if it is ""materialized"", then it should help with selects since the values are physically stored separately).</p>

Just consider each piece of your array an object, or, at the very least, the first level of the array as an object and each sub level as variables inside the object. The build a data structure that you populate with said objects and access the objects through the data structure's given accessors.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Schedule
{
  private String group;
  private String season;
  private String rundays;
  public Schedule() { this.group = null; this.season = null; this.rundays= null; }

Anyway, its more easily reused, understood, and extensible than a hobbled-together Hashtable that tries to imitate your PHP code. Of course, PHP has objects too, and you should use them in a similar fashion instead of your uber-arrays, wherever possible. I do understand the temptation to cheat, though.

<blockquote>
  <p>A.Summer=M<br />
  A.Spring=tTS<br />
  B.Summer=T</p>

<p>Usually I don't like to move static data like this to an external file because it increases the ""distance"" between the data and the code that uses it.  However, whenever you're dealing with nested Collections, especially maps, things can get real ugly, real fast.</p>

<p>If you don't like this idea, maybe you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class WaterScheduler

For example, there are exactly four seasons, and they don't <em>do</em> or <em>store</em> anything.  How does it simplify anything to make them objects?  Wing is quite right that these should probably be <strong><em>constants</em></strong> (or maybe enums).</p>

<p>What Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> build, e.g., <code>Group</code> objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the <code>Group</code> object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.</p>

<p>That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.</p>

<p>Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D""><a href=""http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D"">http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D</a></a></p>

<p>Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:</p>

<pre><code>select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1
</code></pre>

<p>You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:</p>

<pre><code>create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use</p>

<pre><code>insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything
</code></pre>

<p>Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  </p>

<pre><code>select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.</p>

<p>Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.</p>

<p>[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.</p>

<p>One thing i discovered earlier this year on our MySQL databases was the power of composite indexes. For example, if you are reporting on order numbers over date ranges, a composite index on the order number and order date columns could help. I believe MySQL can only use one index for the query so if you just had separate indexes on the order number and order date it would have to decide on just one of them to use. Using the EXPLAIN command can help determine this.</p>

<p>To give an indication of the performance with good indexes (including numerous composite indexes), i can run queries joining 3 tables in our database and get almost instant results in most cases. For more complex reporting most of the queries run in under 10 seconds. These 3 tables have 33 million, 110 million and 140 millions rows respectively. Note that we had also already normalised these slightly to speed up our most common query on the database.</p>

<p>Embedding a DB in Java doesn't make it easier to maintain.  There's now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.</p>

<p>Certainly, it's possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it's worth moving to a database.  That's when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we <em>always</em> assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can't say it'll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.  If there even comes a time when the database is appropriate, <em>then</em> refactor the code to use a database.

<p>The benefit is that if you ever decide to change the way that you handle new lines, you only have to change it in one place.</p>

<p>Of course, a possible negative is that you're calling including an extra function (__autoload()), running that function (when you reference the class), which then loads another file (your class file). That might be more overhead than it's worth.</p>

<p>If I may offer a suggestion, it would be avoiding this sort of echoing that requires echoing tags (like <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>). If you could set up something a little more template-esque, you could handle the nl's without having to explicitly type them. So instead of</p>

<p>There are potentially a couple things that might be happening. First is, the thread might have transitioned from Running to StopRequested, which isn't fully stopped yet, so your logic doesn't create a new thread, and you're trying to start a thread which has just finished running or is about to finish running (neither of which is a valid state for restarting).</p>

<p>The other possibility is that the thread was aborted. Threads which are aborted go to the Aborted state, not the Stopped state, and of course are also not valid for restarting.</p>

<p>Really, the only kind of thread that is still alive that can be ""restarted"" is one that's suspended. You might want to use this conditional instead:</p>

mThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(Monitor));

<p>Enough shilling. Generally speaking, I can summarize their general approach as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create issues in your bug tracker (ex: issue key of PROJ-123).</li>
<li>When you commit code, add ""PROJ-123"" to your commit comment to indicate what bug this code change fixes.</li>
<li>When your CI server checks out the code, scan the commit comments of the diffs. Record any strings matching the regex of your issue keys.</li>
<li>When the build completes, generate a report of what issue keys were found.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically to your second problem:</p>

<p>Your CI doesn't doesn't have to put anything into your bug tracker. Bamboo doesn't put anything into JIRA. Instead, the Atlassian folks have provided a plugin to JIRA that will make a remote api call into Bamboo, asking the question ""Bamboo, to what builds am I (a JIRA issue) related?"".

13468,1436,2008-08-17T01:51:00Z,13460,1,"<p>The common standard for setting up Subversion is to have three folders under the root of your repository: trunk, branches and tags.  The trunk folder holds your current ""main"" line of development. For many shops and situations, this is all they ever use... just a single working repository of code.</p>

<p>The tags folder takes it one step further and allows you to ""checkpoint"" your code at certain points in time. For example, when you release a new build or sometimes even when you simply <em>make</em> a new build, you ""tag"" a copy into this folder. This just allows you to know exactly what your code looked like at that point in time.</p>

<p>The branches folder holds different kinds of branches that you might need in special situations. Sometimes a branch is a place to work on experimental feature or features that might take a long time to get stable (therefore you don't want to introduce them into your main line just yet). Other times, a branch might represent the ""production"" copy of your code which can be edited and deployed independently from your main line of code which contains changes intended for a future release.</p>

I'm not a URL expert, but probably something limiting the appearance of "":""s and ""//""s after the first one would be necessary (but hardly sufficient) to ensure good URLs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the
  DB.</p>
  
  <p>The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.</p>

Straight up concatenation is about 66% of the speed, which is no great shock. The interpolation parser will look, find nothing to do, then finish with a simple internal string concat.

<p>We try to keep a threshold for bugs produced. If this threshold is crossed during testing then the developer is answerable for it. It is up to you to decide what this threshold is (for us it can vary from project to project).</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer modifies a shared library while working on a feature - dev has insight into possible side effects that QA / validation don't</li>
<li>Developer is unsure of performance of library call and writes a unit test</li>
<li>Developer discovers path of use case not considered in spec that code must support, writes code, updates spec, writes test</li>
</ul>

<p>It's arguable how much test duty should be carried out by the dev in the third example, but I argue that it's most efficient for the dev because all of the related minutiae from many layers of documentation and code are already in her short-term memory. This perfect storm may not be attainable by a tester after the fact.</p>

<p>Are we talking about QA or validation? I think of QA along the lines of inspection checklists, code standards enforcement, UI guidelines, etc. If we're talking validation, it doesn't make sense for devs to spend a lot of time authoring and executing formal test cases, but devs must provide all of the rationale and design documentation needed to author good tests.</p>
"
14070,958,2008-08-18T01:08:58Z,14040,17,"<p>It's the difference between ""black box"" testing (where you know what the code is supposed to do, but not how it works), and ""white box"" testing (where knowing how it works drives how you test it). ""Black box"" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance.</p>

<p>I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field <em>a lot</em> if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a ""white hat"" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  </p>

<p>Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  </p>

<p>Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. </p>

<p>For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not ""wasting"" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.  Then, a more traditional QA team can take up the ""black box"" testing.</p>

<p>'==================================================================</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance / Customer tests</strong> <strong><em>=</em>__</strong> <strong>Property testing</strong></p>

<p>Imagine that to be a square with four quadrants. :)</p>

<p>The left half should be automated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer tests verify that the code works as the coder wanted it to.
  Tools: NUnit / xUnit / whatever home-made tool</li>
<li>Customer tests verify that the code works as the customer wanted it to.
The tests should be very easy to write, shouldn't require the customer to learn .NET/Java. Else the customer wont write those tests (although he may require some help of a developer). Fit for example uses HTML tables that can be written in Word.
Tools: FIT
Regression tools also lie here. Record-replay.</li>
</ul>

<p>The right half better utilizes the time &amp; effort of good testers. e.g. No automated test can tell you whether X dialog is usable. Humans are better at this than machines.</p>

<ul>
<li>Usability. Try to Break the System down,( catch unhandled failure scenarios, enter null values ). Basically catch things that the developer missed.</li>
<li>Property testing again requires humans. Here you check customer mandated properties that are required by your system. e.g. Performance - does your search dialog meet the 2 sec response time ? Security- can someone hack into this System ? etc. Availability - is your system online 99.99% of the time ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Testers shouldn't be spending time executing test-plans on the left half. That is the developers responsibility to ensure that the code works as the customer and the developer intended it to. The testers can infact help the customer formulate the acceptance tests..</p>

<p>But keep a few things in mind when making this decision: using any ORM couples you tightly to your data model.  A DBA has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code.  With stored procedures, you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent, since the parameter list and results set(s) returned from a procedure represent its contract, and the innards can be changed around, just so long as that contract is still met.</p>

<p>And also, if Linq is used for more complex queries, tuning the database becomes a much more difficult task.  When a stored procedure is running slow, the DBA can totally focus on the code in isolation, and has lots of options, just so that contract is still satisfied when he/she is done.</p>

<p>I have seen many, many cases where serious problems in an application were addressed by changes to the schema and code in stored procedures without any change to deployed, compiled code.</p>

<li>You can use Visual Studio to open 3rd-party executables, and browse embedded resources (dialogs, string tables, images, etc) stored within.</li>
<li>Debugging visualizers are not exactly a ""hidden"" feature but they are somewhat neglected, and super-useful, since in addition to using the provided visualizers you can <a href=""http://nayyeri.net/blog/how-to-write-a-visual-studio-visualizer/"" rel=""nofollow"">roll your own</a> for specific data sets.</li>
<li>Debugger's ""Set Instruction Pointer"" or ""Set Next Statement"" command.</li>

15956,1000,2008-08-19T10:34:35Z,15690,4,"<p>This sounds very much like my first job. Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.</p>

<p>The big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you <em>will</em> make mistakes and you <em>will</em> need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died.</p>

<p>So my advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Think very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the <strong>simplest</strong> set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do.</p></li>

<p>The simplest hash I ever learned was simply XORing all the bytes together.  It's easy, faster than most complicated hash algorithms and a halfway decent general-purpose hash algorithm for small data sets.  It's the Bubble Sort of hash algorithms really.  Since the simple implementation would leave you with 8 bits, that's only 256 hashes ... not so hot.  You could XOR chunks instead of individal bytes, but then the algorithm gets much more complicated.</p>

<p>So certainly, the cryptographic algorithms are maybe doing some stuff you don't need ... but they're also a huge step up in general-purpose hash quality.  The MD5 hash you're using has 128 bits, with billions and billions of possible hashes.  The only way you're likely to get something better is to take some representative samples of the data you expect to be going through your application and try various algorithms on it to see how many collisions you get.</p>

  <li>Does anyone know of anyway to
  reduce/optimize the PDF export phase
  and or the size of the PDF without
  lowering the total page count?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a few ideas and questions:<br />
1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer ""throwing up its hands"" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be.<br />
2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using <a href=""http://pdfsharp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">PDFSharp</a> after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. Does anyone else have any other
  theories as to why this runs on the
  server but not through the API?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. </p>

<p>You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS).</p>

<p>Of course Haskell's type system allows more ... interesting use of type parameters but this is just a simple example.  With regards to the ""Algebraic Type"" name, i've honestly never been entirely sure of the exact reason for them being named that, but have assumed that it's due the mathematical underpinnings of the type system.  I <em>believe</em> that the reason boils down to the theoretical definition of an ADT being the ""product of a set of constructors"", however it's been a couple of years since i escaped university so i can no longer remember the specifics.</p>

16817,1996,2008-08-19T19:51:39Z,16140,36,"<p>Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you'll need to make your entire app OSGi. In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>

<p>To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>

<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=""http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html"">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like <a href=""http://www.headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/index.php"">Structure 101</a>.</p>

<p>Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you have a <code>Person</code> class and a <code>Group</code> class. A <code>Group</code> instance has many people, so a List here would make sense. When I declare the list object in <code>Group</code> I will use an <code>IList&lt;Person&gt;</code> and instantiate it as a <code>List</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class Group {
  private IList&lt;Person&gt; people;

  public Group() {
    this.people = new List&lt;Person&gt;();
  }
}

<p>This will allow me to do generic processing on almost any array in the .NET framework, unless it uses IEnumerable and not IList, which happens sometimes.</p>

<p>It really comes down to the kind of functionality you need. I'd suggest using the List class in most cases.

The generic interfaces will still work even for heterogenous lists because System.Object can be a T too.  Doing this will save you headache if you decide to use a Stack or some other data structure further down the road.  If all you need to do in the function is foreach through it, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; is really all you should be asking for.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when returning an object out of a function, you want to give the user the richest possible set of operations without them having to cast around.  So in that case, if it's a List&lt;T&gt; internally, return a copy as a List&lt;T&gt;.</p>

<p>(Sorry if it's a little dense.  Markdown seems to be stripping out the blank lines.)</p>

<p>It's pretty simple though once you understand the concepts and all the dependencies are handled automatically.  I should note that we use Visual Studio project files, which have a lot of logic built into them, but this system allows people to build almost identically both within the Visual Studio IDE or at the command line and still gives you the flexibility of adding things to the canonical build like the xUnit testing you see in the script above.</p>

<p>The one PropertyGroup is where all the configuration happens and things can be customized, like excluding certain projects from the build or adding new test assembly masks.</p>

<p>The ItemGroup is where the logic happens that finds all the .csproj files in the tree.</p>

<p>Then there are the targets, which most people familiar with make, nAnt or MSBuild should be able to follow.  If you call the Build target, it calls <em>_Compile, _</em>Deploy and __Test.  The Clean target calls MSBuild on all the project files for them to clean up their directories and then the global deployment directory is deleted.  Rebuild calls Clean and then Build.</p>

<p>Identify the OpenGL extension and the extension APIs you wish to use. OpenGL extensions are listed in the <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/registry/"">OpenGL Extension Registry</a>.</p>

<p>Check if your graphic card supports the extensions you wish to use. Download and install the latest drivers and SDKs for your graphics card.</p>

<p>Recent versions of <a href=""http://developer.nvidia.com/object/sdk_home.html"">NVIDIA OpenGL SDK</a> ship with GLEW. If you're using this, then you don't need to do some of the following steps.</p>

<p>Download <a href=""http://glew.sourceforge.net/"">GLEW</a> and unzip it.</p>

<p>Add the GLEW <strong>bin</strong> path to your Windows <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable. Alternatively, you can also place the <strong>glew32.dll</strong> in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.</p>

<p>Add the GLEW <strong>include</strong> path to your compiler's include directory list.</p>

<p>Add the GLEW <strong>lib</strong> path to your compiler's library directory list.</p>

<p>Instruct your compiler to use <strong>glew32.lib</strong> during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma comment(lib, ""glew32.lib"")
</code></pre>

<p>Add a <code>#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;</code> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include <code>glew.h</code>.)</p>

<p>Initialize GLEW using <code>glewInit()</code> after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup.</p>

<pre><code>if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())
{
    // GLEW failed!
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named <strong>GLEW<em>_your_extension_name</em></strong> which is exposed by GLEW.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)
{
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! You can now use the OpenGL extension calls in your code just as if they existed naturally for Windows.</p>

<ol>
<li>OS dependent</li>
<li>Not quite clear what you're trying to do.</li>

<p>Nevertheless, I'll try to provide some information for you to decide.<br />
On UNIX, <code>fork()</code> creates a clone of your process from the place where you called fork. Meaning, if I have the following process:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf( ""hi 2 u\n"" );
    int mypid = fork();

    if( 0 == mypid )
        printf( ""lol child\n"" );
    else
        printf( ""lol parent\n"" );

    return( 0 );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output will look as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>hi 2 u<br />
    lol child<br />
    lol parent  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When you <code>fork()</code> the pid returned in the child is 0, and the pid returned in the parent is the child's pid. Notice that ""hi2u"" is only printed once... by the <strong>parent</strong>.</p>

<p><code>execve()</code> and its family of functions are almost always used with <code>fork().</code> <code>execve()</code> and the like overwrite the current stackframe with the name of the application you pass to it. <code>execve()</code> is almost always used with <code>fork()</code> where you fork a child process and if you're the parent you do whatever you need to keep doing and if you're the child you exec a new process. <code>execve()</code> is also almost always used with <code>waitpid()</code> -- waitpid takes a pid of a child process and, quite literally, <em>waits</em> until the child terminates and returns the child's exit status to you.  </p>

<p>Using this information, you should be able to write a very basic shell; one that takes process names on the command line and runs processes you tell it to. Of course, shells do more than that, like piping input and output, but you should be able to accomplish the basics using <code>fork()</code>, <code>execve()</code> and <code>waitpid()</code>.</p>

<p>The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all <code>NSTextView</code>s; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to <strong>Preferences</strong> -> <strong>Code Sense</strong> and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++.</p>

<p>Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -> Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Back in <strong>Preferences</strong>,go to <strong>Key Bindings</strong>, and then, under <strong>Menu Key Bindings</strong>, assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do</li>
<li><p>Use the <code>CompletionPrefix</code>.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.</p>

<p>You can see <a href=""http://crookedspin.com/2005/06/10/xcode-macros/"">a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated <code>CompletionPrefix</code>es</a> at <a href=""http://crookedspin.com"">Crooked Spin</a>.</p>

<p>You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file <code>/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro</code>.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve.</p>

<p>This doesn't look bad.  In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a list of all the files</li>
<li>Check for ""required"" files</li>
</ol>

<p>You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files:</p>

<pre><code>checker = {
  ...
  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the ""multiple"" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):</p>

<pre><code>check_dict = {
  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Split the filename based on the delimiter.</li>
<li>Check each of the parts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the <code>parts</code> and <code>patterns</code> have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.</p>

<p>Ignored and required files can be listed.  The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input ""globs"" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of <code>svn:ignore</code> properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.</p>

<p>Here <code>start_dir</code> would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.</p>

<p>The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for ""valid files"".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of <code>parts</code>, which makes sense but adds complexity.</p>

21418,332,2008-08-21T23:20:41Z,21280,5,"<p>LINQ is not just an ORM system, as Jonathan pointed out it brings a lot of functional programming elements to C#. And it lets you do a lot of ""database-y"" things in regular C# code. It's difficult to explain just how incredibly powerful that can be. Consider how much having solid, well designed generic data structures (such as list, stack, dictionary/hash, etc.) included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages. Precisely because using these data structures is very common and reducing the intellectual overhead of using them is a huge benefit. LINQ doesn't do anything you can't do yourself, but it makes a lot of operations a lot more straightforward and a lot easier.</p>

<p>Consider the time-honored example of removing duplicates from a non-ordered list. In a lower level language like C or C++ you'd probably have to sort the list and maintain two indices into the list as you removed dupes. In a language with hashes (Java, C#, Javascript, Perl, etc.) you could create a hash where the keys are the unique values, then extract the keys into a new list. With LINQ you could just do this:</p>

<pre><code>int[] data = { 0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 8, 0, 9, 2, 1 };

var uniqueData = data.GroupBy(i =&gt; i).Select(g =&gt; g.Key);

If you aim to launch a site next week and want a huge audience, Silverlight is not an option.

21967,1630,2008-08-22T09:13:56Z,21560,3,"<p>I finally got Multisampling working with my wxWidgets OpenGL program. It's a bit messy right now, but here's how:</p>

<p><strong>wxWidgets</strong> doesn't have <strong>Multisampling</strong> support in their <strong>stable releases</strong> right now (latest version at this time is <strong>2.8.8</strong>). But, it's available as a patch and also through their daily snapshot. (The latter is heartening, since it means that the patch has been accepted and should appear in later stable releases if there are no issues.)</p>

<p>So, there are 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and build from their <strong><a href=""http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/pub/Daily_HEAD/"" rel=""nofollow"">daily snapshot</a></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the <strong><a href=""https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=309863&amp;aid=1915804&amp;group_id=9863"" rel=""nofollow"">patch</a></strong> for your working wxWidgets installation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I found the 2nd option to be less cumbersome, since I don't want to disturb my working installation as much as possible. If you don't know how to patch on Windows, see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19611/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.</p>

<p>At the very least, for Windows, the patch will modify the following files:</p>

<pre><code>$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/src/msw/glcanvas.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>After patching, <strong>recompile</strong> the wxWidgets libraries.</p>

<p>To enable multisampling in your wxWidgets OpenGL program, minor changes to the code are required.</p>

<p>An attribute list needs to be passed to the <strong>wxGLCanvas</strong> constructor:</p>

<pre><code>int attribList[] = {WX_GL_RGBA,
                    WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER,
                    WX_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE, // Multi-sampling
                    WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16,
                    0, 0};
</code></pre>

<p>If you were already using an attribute list, then add the line with <code>GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE</code> to it. Else, add this attribute list definition to your code.</p>

<p>Then modify your wxGLCanvas constructor to take this attribute list as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>myGLFrame::myGLFrame    // Derived from wxGLCanvas
(
    wxWindow *parent,
    wxWindowID id,
    const wxPoint&amp; pos,
    const wxSize&amp; size,
    long style,
    const wxString&amp; name
)
: wxGLCanvas(parent, (wxGLCanvas*) NULL, id, pos, size, style, name, attribList)
{
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the wxGLCanvas element is created, multisampling is turned on by default. To disable or enable it at will, use the related OpenGL calls:</p>

<pre><code>glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
</code></pre>

<p>Multisampling should now work with the wxWidgets OpenGL program. Hopefully, it should be supported in the stable release of wxWidgets soon, making this information irrelevant :-)</p>

<p>I don't think there's a technical limitation as such on shipping System.Web as part of your app, though it's slightly odd that they've put that notice in on the .NET 3.5 page.

<pre><code>SELECT @activityDateMidnight = '1/1/2008', @activityDateTZ = 'EST'

<p>The only real solution is HTTPS. If you don't want to do SSL on your whole site (maybe you have performance concerns), you might be able to get away with only SSL protecting the sensitive areas. To do that, first make sure your login page is HTTPS. When a user logs in, set a secure cookie (meaning the browser will only transmit it over an SSL link) in addition to the regular session cookie. Then, when a user visits one of your ""sensitive"" areas, redirect them to HTTPS, and check for the presence of that secure cookie. A real user will have it, a session hijacker will not.</p>

<p>I actually think this is an interesting question. I'm not sure how useful it is, but it is a valid question.</p>

<p>@Ed</p>

<p>Can you provide a little more info on this question? You said the dimension of the array is dynamic, but is the number of elements dynamic as well?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm going to try and answer the question anyways. I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ...</p>

<p>Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, <code>array_care[4][4][4]</code> for 1,2, and 6. The <code>array_care[4][4][4]</code> will hold the end result.</p>

<p>Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array <code>input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4]</code> to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6.</p>

<p>We need to define some temporary indexes:</p>

<pre><code>int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes:</p>

<pre><code>int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};
int i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>This order is important for doing what you requested.</p>

<p>Define a termination flag:</p>

<pre><code>bool terminate=false;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create our loop:</p>

<pre><code>while (terminate)
{
array_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];

while ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) &amp;&amp; (i &lt; 8))
{
dim[increase_index_order[i]]=0;
i++;
}

if (i &lt; 8) {
dim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;
} else {
terminate=true;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should work for 8 dimensions, caring about 3 dimensions. It would take a bit more time to make it dynamic, and I don't have the time. Hope this helps. I apologize, but I haven't learned the code markups yet. :(</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the ""this"" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. </p>

<p>It's really just a style issue. If you like ""this"", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the ""most aesthetically pleasing code"" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. </p>

<p>I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.</p>

<p>You can avoid the first usage by not having member and local variables with the same name in scope, for example by following common naming conventions and using properties (Pascal case) instead of fields (camel case) to avoid colliding with local variables (also camel case). In C# 3.0 fields can be converted to properties easily by using <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384054.aspx"">auto-implemented properties</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I find this to be too prevalent as well. This is not Object Oriented Programming. It's Object Based Programming and data centric programing. In my 10 years of working with OO Languages, I see people mostly doing Object Based Programming. OBP breaks down very quickly IMHO since you are essentially getting the worst of both words: 1) Procedural programming without adhering to proven structured programming methodology and 2) OOP without adhering to to proven OOP methodology.  </p>

<p>OOP done right is a beautiful thing. It makes very difficult problems easy to solve, and to the uninitiated (not trying to sound pompous there), it can almost seem like magic. That being said, OOP is just one tool in the toolbox of programming methodologies. It is not the be all end all methodology. It just happens to suit large business applications well.   </p>

<p>Most developers who work in OOP languages are utilizing examples of OOP done right in the frameworks and types that they use day-to-day, but they just aren't aware of it. Here are some very simple examples: ADO.NET, Hibernate/NHibernate, Logging Frameworks, various language collection types, the ASP.NET stack, The JSP stack etc...

Make sure that whenever a user clicks on your site's ""log out"" link, that the old session UUID can never be used again. </p>

<p>I'm not sure if this idea will work but here goes: Add a serial number into your session cookie, maybe a string like this:</p>

<p>SessionUUID, Serial Num, Current Date/Time</p>

<p>Encrypt this string and use it as your session cookie. Regularly change the serial num - maybe when the cookie is 5 minutes old and then reissue the cookie.  You could even reissue it on every page view if you wanted to. On the server side, keep a record of the last serial num you've issued for that session.  If someone ever sends a cookie with the wrong serial number it means that an attacker may be using a cookie they intercepted earlier so invalidate the session UUID and ask the user to reenter their password and then reissue a new cookie.</p>

<p>There are three reasons why a sealed class is better than an unsealed class:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Versioning</strong>: When a class is originally sealed, it can change to unsealed in the future without breaking compatibility. (â¦)</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: (â¦) if the JIT compiler sees a call to a virtual method using a sealed types, the JIT compiler can produce more efficient code by calling the method non-virtually.(â¦)</li>
<li><strong>Security and Predictability</strong>: A class must protect its own state and not allow itself to ever become corrupted. When a class is unsealed, a derived class can access and manipulate the base classâs state if any data fields or methods that internally manipulate fields are accessible and not private.(â¦)</li>

<p>As a perfect example, I was recently creating a small package (Java, not C#, but same principles) to wrap functionality around the memcached tool.  I wanted an interface so in tests I could mock away the memcached client API I was using, and also so we could switch clients if the need arose (there are 2 clients listed on the memcached homepage).  Additionally, I wanted to have the opportunity to replace the functionality altogether if the need or desire arose (such as if the memcached servers are down for some reason, we could potentially hot swap with a local cache implementation instead).</p>

<p>I exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client API, and it would have been awesome to extend the client API class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface.  The methods that I had in the interface that matched the actual interface would then need no further details and so I wouldn't have to explicitly implement them.  However, the class was sealed, so I had to instead proxy calls to an internal reference to this class.  The result: more work and a lot more code for no real good reason.</p>

<p>That said, I think there are potential times when you might want to make a class sealed... and the best thing I can think of is an API that you will invoke directly, but allow clients to implement.  For example, a game where you can program against the game... if your classes were not sealed, then the players who are adding features could potentially exploit the API to their advantage.  This is a very narrow case though, and I think any time you have full control over the codebase, there really is little if any reason to make a class sealed.</p>

<p>This is one reason I really like the Ruby programming language... even the core classes are open, not just to extend but to ADD AND CHANGE functionality dynamically, TO THE CLASS ITSELF!  It's called monkeypatching and can be a nightmare if abused, but it's damn fun to play with!</p>

24652,855,2008-08-23T22:01:43Z,24620,0,"<p>Not everything that's important in a class is asserted easily in code. There can be semantics and relationships present that are easily broken by inheriting and overriding methods. Overriding one method at a time is an easy way to do this.  You design a class/object as a single meaningful entity and then someone comes along and thinks if a method or two were 'better' it would do no harm.  That may or may not be true.  Maybe you can correctly separate all methods between private and not private or virtual and not virtual but that still may not be enough. Demanding inheritance of all classes also puts a huge additional burden on the original developer to foresee all the ways an inheriting class could screw things up.<br />
I don't know of a perfect solution. I'm sympathetic to preventing inheritance but that's also a problem because it hinders unit testing. </p>

<p>That's a great reason indeed. Thus, for performance-critical classes, <code>sealed</code> and friends make sense.</p>

<p>All the other reasons I've seen mentioned so far boil down to ""nobody touches my class!"". If you're worried someone might misunderstand its internals, you did a poor job documenting it. You can't possibly know that there's nothing useful to add to your class, or that you already know every imaginable use case for it. Even if you're right and the other developer shouldn't have used your class to solve their problem, using a keyword isn't a great way of preventing such a mistake. Documentation is. If they ignore the documentation, their loss.</p>

<p>The biggest change you will find migrating to SVN is the idea of ""Check out"" and ""Check in"" aren't exactly the same as ""Update"" and ""Commit"". . . thus, any IDE integration with VB6 is limited because VB6 supports MSSCCI, a check-out/check-in mechanism.  I once used TamTam SVN (<a href=""http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml"">http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml</a>) with Visual Studio 2003, but stopped since I found it limiting.

<p>Given that, I would set up Subversion to require ""locking"" on .frx files.  This means that only one person can check the file out at a time.

<p>So if you have a class for which there can not be any particular cases that specialize its behavior it should be sealed.</p>

<p>Also due to LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) one can use derived class where base class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance: code using base class <em>may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected</em>. In order to protect external code when there is no obvious need for subclasses you seal the class and its clients can rely that its behavior will not be changed. Otherwise external code needs to be explicitly designed to expect possible changes in behavior in subclasses.</p>

<p>That, of course, is quite <em>rare</em> unfortunately.

<p>There are some problems none of the above points cover (certain types of calculated fields would require writing a JS library for, me thinks) but it's certainly a good start.</p>

It supports hierarchical selectors (using indentation to establish hierarchies), among other things, which makes life easier to an extend from a syntactical perspective (you repeat yourself a lot less). </p>

<p>I am certainly with you, though. While I would consider myself a small-time CSS expert, I think it would be nice if there were tools for CSS like there are with Javascript (Prototype, JQuery, etc.). You tell the tool what you want, and it handles the browser inconsistencies behind-the-scenes. That would be ideal, methinks.</p>
"
25534,40,2008-08-25T01:17:19Z,25450,6,"<p>This elaborates on my previous answer.</p>

<p>When I first started using CSS I also thought it was a pain that it didn't support variables, expressions, etc.  But as I started to use it more and more, I developed a different style to overcome these issues.  </p>

<p>For example, instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>a { color: red }
.entry { color: red }
h1 { color: red }
</code></pre>

<p>You can do:</p>

<pre><code>a, .entry, h1 { color: red }
</code></pre>

<p>You can keep the color declared in one spot by doing this.</p>

<p>Once you use CSS enough you should be able to overcome most browser inconsistencies easily.  If you find that you need to use a CSS hack there is probably a better way to do it.</p>

<li>Solid Documentation - The docs are clear and to the point, with great examples</li>
<li>Deep per-platform support - There are some unique features in the window service management system that are supported perfectly by service wrapper (w/o restarting).  And on Windows, you will even see your app name in the process list instead of just ""java.exe"".</li>
<li>Standards Compliant - Unlike many ad-hoc Java init scripts, the scripts for service wrapper tend to be compliant with LSB standards.  This can end up being very important if you ever want high availability management from something like Linux Heartbeat/HA.</li>

<p>CSS contains the aural media type specifically to control the ""rendering"" of things when screen readers are doing their work.  So, for you example, you would only set it as visible for the aural media type.  </p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>@Ross</p>

<p>I'm quite aware that the screen reader doesn't actually read the screen, but you would think that to work well, it would have to build a model of what a person with sight would see, otherwise, it seems like it would do a really poor job of getting across to the user what's actually on the page.  Also , putting things in the order you would read them doesn't really work, as a sighted person would scan the page quickly and read the section they want to read.  Do you put the contents first so that the user has to listen to them every time, or do you put them at the end so that they can get to the content first?  Also, putting content in order would mean some tricky CSS to get things positioned where you wanted them to be for sighted users.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>It seems to me that most web pages contain very similar construction, and that it should be possible to, in many cases, pick out where the repeated headers and side columns are. When viewing many subsequent pages on the same site with the same formatting, it should be easy to figure out which sections are navigation, and which are content.  Doing this, the screen reader could completely skip the navigation sections, and move right onto the content, as most sighted users would do.</p>

<p>I realize there are limitations, and that doing these types of things wouldn't be easy.  However, I feel like as far as screen readers go, we only did the bare minimum and left it at that. </p>

<p>In general, my advice would be to bite the bullet and go the whole way at once.

If you'd rather leave your files where they are, you can set up virtual hosts and even map them to addresses that you can type into your browser (for example, I have a local.mrwarshaw.com address that resolves to the web root of my personal site's development folder).</p>

<p>Most places where I have worked have folowed this practice. I've actually written coding standards for BAE (Aust.) along with the reasons why instead of just carving something in stone with no real justification.</p>

<p>Concerning your question about source files, it's not so much time to compile but more an issue of being able to find the relevant code snippet in the first place. Not everyone is using an IDE. And knowing that you just look for MyClass.h and MyClass.cpp really saves time compared to running ""grep MyClass *.(h|cpp)"" over a bunch of files and then filtering out the #include MyClass.h statements...</p>

<p>Mind you there are work-arounds for the impact of large numbers of source files on compile times. See Large Scale C++ Software Design by John Lakos for an interesting discussion.</p>

We then refactored the code to make it go through one connection only.</p>

Unless we're starting a transaction on each connection, it often is handled in the connection pool.  I know that's very brand-specific, but most(?) database systems' cilent access will pool connections to the best of its ability.</p>

<p>As an aside, we did have a problem with connection count because of cross-database connections.  Informix supports synonyms, so we synonymed the common offenders and the multiple connections were handled server-side, saving a lot in transfer time, connection creation overhead, and (the real crux of our situtation) license fees.</p>

<p>Additionally, throwing a ton of extra connections at the DB doesn't help anything unless there are resources on the DB server sitting idle.  If you've got 8 cores and only one is being used to satisfy a query, then sure, making another connection might help.  More likely, though, you are already using all the available cores.  You're also likely hitting the same harddrive for every DB request, and adding additional lock contention.</p>

<p>If your DB has anything resembling high utilization, adding extra connections won't help.  That'd be like spawning extra threads in an application with the blind hope that the extra concurrency will make processing faster.  It <em>might</em> in some certain circumstances, but in other cases it'll just slow you down as you thrash the hard drive, waste time task-switching, and introduce synchronization overhead.</p>

28992,2069,2008-08-26T20:04:51Z,14530,165,"<p>Some advantages of LINQ over sprocs:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Type safety</strong>: I think we all understand this.</li>
<li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: This is especially true with <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386964.aspx"">LINQ-to-Entities</a>.  This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163329.aspx"">PLINQ</a> is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging support</strong>: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isn't enough).</li>
<li><strong>Vendor agnostic</strong>: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Others have mentioned this already, but it's easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.</li>
<li><strong>Easier</strong>: You don't have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Network traffic</strong>: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQ's abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.</li>
<li><strong>Less flexible</strong>: Sprocs can take full advantage of a database's featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in it's support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).</li>
<li><strong>Recompiling</strong>: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can <em>sometimes</em> allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>Security and manageability are something that people argue about too.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table <em>views</em> to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  </li>
<li><strong>Manageability</strong>: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.</li>
</ol>

<p>I used to be a big sproc guy, but I'm starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then I'll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)</p>

<li>Look for people (whether or not they are in those forums) that you trust, and let them in in a closed beta. This will allow you to iron out serious kinks at first.</li>

29903,2951,2008-08-27T11:04:47Z,29870,2,"<p>This is my general approach to testing/launching.
How you test/launch depends mostly on:</p>

<ol>
<li>What your application <strong>is</strong>.</li>
<li>Who your users <strong>are</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you application is a technical application and is geared to the technically-minded, the word ""beta"" won't really scare them - but provide an opportunity to test the product before it goes 'live', and help to improve the system.  This is the ideal circumstance in which to use either an open or closed beta.  It's usually beneficial to start off 'closed' with a group of people you select and trust to bug-find quickly and reliably - after you're more confident that all the critical bugs are gone, open it up with an invite system (for example).</p>

<p>If, however, your application is 'trivial' from a technical standpoint (i.e. it's something like Twitter, or Facebook, or Flickr - nothing that is inherently geared towards technical usage), then you're going to have to be more careful in how you plan your testing.  Closed testing is most definitely your first port of call, and this should last for longer than a closed beta on a more 'technical' product.  The reason?  Your 'average Joe' doesn't necessarily know what the word ""beta"" means, and others may well be scared by it, or judge your service prematurely (not understanding the concept of this 'public testing' phase).  Many won't want to be used as guinea pigs.</p>

<p>I assume that you've done your bind using INADDR_ANY to specify the address.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then the semantics of INADDR_ANY is such that a UDP socket is created on the port specified on all of your interfaces. The socket is going to get all packets sent to all interfaces on the port specified.</p>

<p>When sending using this socket, the lowest numbered interface is used. The outgoing sender's address field is set to the IP address of that first outgoing interface used.</p>

<p>First outgoing interface is defined as the sequence when you do an ifconfig -a. It will probably be eth0.</p>

<p>I used to get frustrated with writing unit tests until I start mocking the data access portion so I didn't have to create a test db or generate test data on the fly.  By mocking the data you can generate it all at run time and be sure that your objects work properly with known inputs.</p>

I chose to use a custom form rather than a custom FormTemplate simply because I'm doing a lot of stuff that's not very SharePoint list-like (making ajax calls to get info from a third-party app then generating some dynamic form elements based on that ajax result, then subsequent processing of that data on postback).  I thought it'd be a nightmare to try this within the usual custom rendering template mechanism.</p>

<p>I also don't think I can supply the custom form declarations in the list definition itself, because I have multiple content types associated with this list, and each content type has its own custom form (the other type is thankfully much simpler).</p>

<p>Actually, my simple way of keeping the list guid in my hidden field was a very low impact way to address this specific problem.  My main concern is that I'm not sure why the SPContext just loses all its usefulness when I postback here, which makes me think I'm doing something wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a script that will wipe out database before you start unit tests, then populate db with predefined set of data and run the tests. You can also do that before every test &ndash; it'll be slow, but less error prone.</li>
<li><p>Inject the database. (Example in pseudo-Java, but applies to all OO-languages) <pre>
class Database {
 public Result query(String query) {... real db here ...}
}</p>

<p>class MockDatabase extends Database {
  public Result query(String query) { 
    return ""mock result""; 
  }
}</p>

<p>class ObjectThatUsesDB {
 public ObjectThatUsesDB(Database db) { 
   this.database = db; 
 }
}
</pre>
now in production you use normal database and for all tests you just inject the mock database that you can create ad hoc.</p></li>
<li>Do not use DB at all throughout most of code (that's a bad practice anyway). Create a ""database"" object that instead of returning  with results will return normal objects (i.e. will return <code>User</code> instead of a tuple <code>{name: ""marcin"", password: ""blah""}</code>) write all your tests with ad hoc constructed <em>real</em> objects and write one big test that depends on a database that makes sure this conversion works OK.</li>

30772,2349,2008-08-27T18:14:54Z,30710,9,"<p>The easiest way to unit test an object with database access is using transaction scopes. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>    [Test]
	[ExpectedException(typeof(NotFoundException))]
	public void DeleteAttendee() {

		using(TransactionScope scope = new TransactionScope()) {
			Attendee anAttendee = Attendee.Get(3);
			anAttendee.Delete();
			anAttendee.Save();

			//Try reloading. Instance should have been deleted.
			Attendee deletedAttendee = Attendee.Get(3);
		}
	}
</code></pre>

<p>This will revert back the state of the database, basically like a transaction rollback so you can run the test as many times as you want without any sideeffects. We've used this approach successfully in large projects. Our build does take a little long to run (15 minutes), but it is not horrible for having 1800 unit tests. Also, if build time is a concern, you can change the build process to have multiple builds, one for building src, another that fires up afterwards that handles unit tests, code analysis, packaging, etc...</p>

"
30818,3271,2008-08-27T18:30:47Z,30710,56,"<p>I would suggest mocking out your calls to the database.  Mocks are basically objects that look like the object you are trying to call a method on, in the sense that they have the same properties, methods, etc. available to caller.  But instead of performing whatever action they are programmed to do when a particular method is called, it skips that altogether, and just returns a result. That result is typically defined by you ahead of time.  </p>

<p>In order to set up your objects for mocking, you probably need to use some sort of inversion of control/ dependency injection pattern, as in the following pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>class Bar
{
    private FooDataProvider _dataProvider;

    public instantiate(FooDataProvider dataProvider) {
        _dataProvider = dataProvider;
    }

    public getAllFoos() {
        // instead of calling Foo.GetAll() here, we are introducing an extra layer of abstraction
        return _dataProvider.GetAllFoos();
    }
}

class FooDataProvider
{
    public Foo[] GetAllFoos() {
        return Foo.GetAll();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now in your unit test, you create a mock of FooDataProvider, which allows you to call the method GetAllFoos without having to actually hit the database.</p>

<pre><code>class BarTests
{
    public TestGetAllFoos() {
        // here we set up our mock FooDataProvider
        mockRepository = MockingFramework.new()
        mockFooDataProvider = mockRepository.CreateMockOfType(FooDataProvider);

        // create a new array of Foo objects
        testFooArray = new Foo[] {Foo.new(), Foo.new(), Foo.new()}

        // the next statement will cause testFooArray to be returned every time we call FooDAtaProvider.GetAllFoos,
        // instead of calling to the database and returning whatever is in there
        // ExpectCallTo and Returns are methods provided by our imaginary mocking framework
        ExpectCallTo(mockFooDataProvider.GetAllFoos).Returns(testFooArray)

        // now begins our actual unit test
        testBar = new Bar(mockFooDataProvider)
        baz = testBar.GetAllFoos()

        // baz should now equal the testFooArray object we created earlier
        Assert.AreEqual(3, baz.length)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A common mocking scenario, in a nutshell.  Of course you will still probably want to unit test your actual database calls too, for which you will need to hit the database.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me explain what all that means. 
  Threads run inside the same virtual
  machine, and hence run on the same
  physical machine.  Processes can run
  on the same physical machine or in
  another physical machine.  If you
  architect your application around
  threads, youâve done nothing to access
  multiple machines.  So, you can scale
  to as many cores are on the single
  machine (which will be quite a few
  over time), but to really reach web
  scales, youâll need to solve the
  multiple machine problem anyway.</p>

WPF seems to be getting stuff added to it with each new release of the framework but the things you learn aren't being superceded or invalidated.</p>

<p>The only breaking change I've seen in my own WPF applications with a new release of the framework was one recently in 3.5 SP1, and that was because we were unknowingly relying on a bug to get a certain behaviour from our code.

A lot of important work went into standardizing the C library, too.  Even though the standard C library was a codification of existing practice, it codified <em>multiple</em> existing practices, which made it more difficult.  P.J. Plauger's book, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131315099""><em>The Standard C Library</em></a>, is a great reference, and also tells some of the behind-the-scenes details of <em>why</em> the library ended up the way it did.</p>

<p>The ANSI/ISO standard C is very similar to K&amp;R C in most ways.  It was intended that most existing C code should build on ANSI compilers without many changes.  Crucially, though, in the pre-standard era, the semantics of the language were open to interpretation by each compiler vendor.  ANSI C brought in a common description of language semantics which put all the compilers on an equal footing.  It's easy to take this for granted now, some 20 years later, but this was a significant achievement.</p>

<p>For the most part, if you don't have a pre-standard C codebase to maintain, you should be glad you don't have to worry about it.  If you do--or worse yet, if you're trying to bring an old program up to more modern standards--then you have my sympathies.</p>

<p>Whether an index is used doesn't so much vary on the type of query as much of the type and distribution of data in the table(s), how up-to-date your table statistics are, and the actual datatype of the column.</p>

<p>The other posters are correct that an index will be used over a table scan if:</p>

<ul>
<li>The query won't access more than a certain percent of the rows indexed (say ~10% but should vary between DBMS's).</li>
<li>Alternatively, if there are a lot of rows, but relatively few unique values in the column, it also may be faster to do a table scan.</li>

<p>The other variable that might not be that obvious is making sure that the datatypes of the values being compared are the same. In PostgreSQL, I don't think that indexes will be used if you're filtering on a float but your column is made up of ints. There are also some operators that don't support index use (again, in PostgreSQL, the ILIKE operator is like this).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question One :
  Do you anticipate a need for any of the clever handlers that Log4j has that JUL does not have, such as the SMTPHandler, NTEventLogHandler, or any of the very convenient FileHandlers?</p>
  
  <p>Question Two :
  Do you see yourself wanting to frequently switch the format of your logging output? Will you need an easy, flexible way to do so? In other words, do you need Log4j's PatternLayout?</p>
  
  <p>Question Three :
  Do you anticipate a definite need for the ability to change complex logging configurations in your applications, after they are compiled and deployed in a production environment? Does your configuration sound something like, ""Severe messages from this class get sent via e-mail to the support guy; severe messages from a subset of classes get logged to a syslog deamon on our server; warning messages from another subset of classes get logged to a file on network drive A; and then all messages from everywhere get logged to a file on network drive B""? And do you see yourself tweaking it every couple of days?</p>
  
  <p>If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, go with Log4j. If you answer a definite no to all of them, JUL will be more than adequate and it's conveniently already included in the SDK.</p>

In the case of unique IDs and a large enough table then I'd expect the optimiser to use an index.</p>

<p>If the items in the list were to be non-unique however, and I guess in the example that a ""TypeId"" is a foreign key, then I'm more interested in the distribution. I'm wondering if the optimiser will check the stats for each value in the list? Say it checks the first value and finds it's in 20% of the rows (of a large enough table to matter). It'll probably table scan. But will the same query plan be used for the other two, even if they're unique?</p>

<p>It's probably moot - something like an Employee table is likely to be small enough that it will stay cached in memory and you probably wouldn't notice a difference between that and indexed retrieval anyway.</p>

<p>And lastly, while I'm preaching, beware the query in the IN clause: it's often a quick way to get something working and (for me at least) can be a good way to express the requirement, but it's almost always better restated as a join. Your optimiser may be smart enough to spot this, but then again it may not. If you don't currently performance-check against production data volumes, do so - in these days of cost-based optimisation you can't be certain of the query plan until you have a full load and representative statistics.

But it's also much more limiting -- [A-Za-z] does <em>not</em> match accented international characters, it's literally the A-Za-z ASCII set and nothing more.</p>

<p>I don't know if you saw Tim Bray's answer to my message, but it's a good one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the trickiest issues in internationalized search is upper and lower case. This notion of case is limited to languages written in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. English-speakers naturally expect search to be case-insensitive if only because theyâre lazy: if Nadia Jones wants to look herself up on Google sheâll probably just type in nadia jones and expect the system to take care of it.</p>
  
  <p>So itâs fairly common for search systems to ânormalizeâ words by converting them all to lower- or upper-case, both for indexing and queries.</p>
  
  <p>The trouble is that the mapping between cases is not always as straightforward as it is in English. For example, the German lower-case character âÃâ becomes âSSâ when upper-cased, and good old capital âIâ when down-cased in Turkish becomes the dotless âÄ±â (yes, they have âiâ, its upper-case version is âÄ°â). I have read (but not verified first-hand) that the rules for upcasing accented characters such âÃ©â are different in France and QuÃ©bec. One of the results of all this is that software such as java.String.toLowerCase() tends to run astonishingly slow as it tries to work around all these corner-cases.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, though. One place you see buffers (output this time) is in the servlet API. Data isn't written to the underlying stream until <em>flush()</em> is called, allowing you to buffer output but then dump the buffer if an error occurs and write an error page instead. You might buffer input if you needed to reset the stream for rereading using <em>mark(int)</em> and <em>reset()</em>.

SQL Server that this level of locking is allowed, when locking is going to
occur. For example, if ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS was off, the only possible locks

For example, if you find out that your class would be useful from a web app, or some kind of message consuming app, it would be nice to allow those containers the opportunity to deal with the failure somehow. A container may want to retry the operation, decide to log and ignore the problem, send an email to an administrator, etc.</p>

<p>cdrecord has no problem burning just about any type of media you throw at it, but since it is a stand alone application, I had to do a lot of parsing to get useful information.  I can dig up the flags and different calls I used if you are interested, but unfortunately I cannot share the source as it was developed for a commercial project.</p>

<p>While looking over the code I was also reminded that I switched form cdrecord (cdrtools) to wodim (<a href=""http://www.cdrkit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">cdrkit</a>).  wodim is a branch of cdrecord made a few years ago by the debian team because cdrecord dropped the GPL license.</p>

<p>Like I said before this was released as part of a commercial application, our interpretation of the GPL was that you can call external binaries from your program without a problem as long as your program can run without the external binaries (if cdrecord wasn't found we popped up a dialog informing the user that burning capabilities were not available) and we also had to host the source for cdrkit and cygwin and include a copy of the GPL with our distributed program.  So basically we would not make ""derivative works"", we would compile the cdrkit code exactly as it was, and then use the produced binaries.</p>

33580,2954,2008-08-28T22:45:33Z,33510,1,"<p>Just to cite an example: for .NET apps there are the CAB (Composite Application Block) and the Composite Application Guidance for WPF. Both are mainly implementations of a set of several design patterns focused on modularity and loose coupling between components similar to a plug-in architecture: you have an IOC framework, MVC base classes, a loosely coupled event broker, dynamic loading of modules and other stuff.</p>

<p>So I suppose that kind of pattern infrastructure is what you are trying to find, just not specifically for .NET. But if you see the CAB as a set of pattern implementations, you can see that almost every language and platform has some form of already built-in or third party frameworks for individual patterns. </p>

<p>So my take would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Study (if you are not familiar with) some of those design patterns. You could take as an example the CAB framework for WPF documentation: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707841.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Patterns in the Composite Application Library</a></li>
<li>Design your architecture thinking on which of those patterns you think would be useful for what you want to achieve <b>first without thinking in specific pattern implementations or products</b>.</li>
<li>Once you have your 'architectural requirements' defined more specifically, look for individual frameworks that help accomplish each one of those patterns/features for the language you decide to use and put together your own application framework based on them.</li>
</ol>

<p>I agree that the hard part is to make all this platform independent. I really cannot think on any other solution to choose a mature platform independent language like Java.</p>
"
33584,493,2008-08-28T22:48:31Z,31500,1,"<p>@Mike: Thanks for the detailed analysis. There are definately some interesting points you make there. The example I posted is somewhat trivial but the basis of the question came from using NHibernate.</p>

<p>With NHibernate, you can write a clause like this:</p>

<pre><code>int[] employeeIds = new int[]{1, 5, 23463, 32523};
NHibernateSession.CreateCriteria(typeof(Employee))
.Add(Restrictions.InG(""EmployeeId"",employeeIds))
</code></pre>

<p>NHibernate then generates a query which looks like  </p>

<pre><code>select * from employee where employeeid in (1, 5, 23463, 32523)
</code></pre>

<p>So as you and others have pointed out, it looks like there are going to be times where an index will be used or a table scan will happen, but you can't really determine that until runtime.</p>
"
33587,3488,2008-08-28T22:51:31Z,33510,1,"<p>If you want platform independence, then you'll have to trade off between performance and development effort. C++ may be faster than Java (this is debatable FWIW) but you'll get platform independence a lot more easily with Java. Python and Ruby are in the same boat.</p>

<p>I doubt that .NET would be much faster than Java (they're both VM languages after all), but the big problem with .NET is platform independence. Mono has a noble goal and surprisingly good results so far but it will <em>always</em> be playing catch-up with Microsoft on Windows. You might be able to accept its limitations but it's still not the same as having identical multiplatform environments that Java, Python, and Ruby have. Also: the .NET development and support tools are heavily skewed towards Windows, and probably always will be.</p>

<p>IMO, your best bet is to target Java... or, at the very least, the JVM. If you don't like the Java language (and as a C# dev I'm guessing that's not the case) then you at least have options like Jython, JRuby, and Scala. With the JVM, you get very good platform independence, good performance, and access to a huge number of libraries and support tools. There's almost always a Java library, port or implementation that will do what you need it to do. I don't think any other platform out there has the same number of options; there's real value in that flexibility.</p>

<p>As for modularity: that's more about how you build the software than what platform you use. I don't know much about plugin architectures like you describe but I'm guessing that it will be possible in pretty much any modern platform you pick.</p>

This way, if your application is not running as a stand-alone app the caller can react to it and has some information about what went wrong. It is also easier for debugging purposes because you as well get a better idea about what went wrong when you see a stack trace.</p>

<p>One important thing to note is that when the exception reaches the top level and therefore causes the VM to quit the VM returns a return code of 1, therefore outside applications that use the return code see that something went wrong.</p>

<p>The only case where I think System.exit() makes sense is when your app is meant to be called by applications which are not Java and therefore have to use return codes to see if your app worked or not and you want those applications to have a chance to react differently on different things going wrong, i.e. you need different return codes.</p>

The essence of OOP is that objects have knowledge and responsibility, can actually do things and cooperate with other classes.

34550,142,2008-08-29T16:05:23Z,34510,587,"<p>A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. </p>

<p>Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g:</p>

<pre><code>if (x == 5) // The ""Check""
{
   y = x * 2; // The ""Act""

   // If another thread changed x in between ""if (x == 5)"" and ""y = x * 2"" above,
   // y will not be equal to 10.
}
</code></pre>

<p>The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.</p>

<p>In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Obtain lock for x
if (x == 5)
{
   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. 
              // Therefore y = 10
}
// release lock for x

"
34578,3575,2008-08-29T16:12:09Z,34510,14,"<p>Race conditions occur in multi-threaded applications or multi-process systems.  A race condition, at its most basic, is anything that makes the assumption that two things not in the same thread or process will happen in a particular order, without taking steps to ensure that they do.  This happens commonly when two threads are passing messages by setting and checking member variables of a class both can access.  There's almost always a race condition when one thread calls sleep to give another thread time to finish a task (unless that sleep is in a loop, with some checking mechanism).</p>

<p>Tools for preventing race conditions are dependent on the language and OS, but some comon ones are mutexes, critical sections, and signals.  Mutexes are good when you want to make sure you're the only one doing something.  Signals are good when you want to make sure someone else has finished doing something.  Minimizing shared resources can also help prevent unexpected behaviors</p>

<p>Detecting race conditions can be difficult, but there are a couple signs.  Code which relies heavily on sleeps is prone to race conditions, so first check for calls to sleep in the affected code.  Adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events.  This can be useful for reproducing the behavior, seeing if you can make it disappear by changing the timing of things, and for testing solutions put in place.  The sleeps should be removed after debugging.</p>

<p>The signature sign that one has a race condition though, is if there's an issue that only occurs intermittently on some machines.  Common bugs would be crashes and deadlocks.  With logging, you should be able to find the affected area and work back from there.</p>

<p>If you had 5 threads executing this code at once, the value of x WOULD NOT end up being 50,000,000.  It would in fact vary with each run.</p>

<p>This is because, in order for each thread to increment the value of x, they have to do the following: (simplified, obviously)</p>

<pre>
Retrieve the value of x
Add 1 to this value
Store this value to x
</pre>

<p>Any thread can be at any step in this process at any time, and they can step on each other when a shared resource is involved.  The state of x can be changed by another thread during the time between x is being read and when it is written back.</p>

<p>Let's say a thread retrieves the value of x, but hasn't stored it yet.  Another thread can also retrieve the <b>same</b> value of x (because no thread has changed it yet) and then they would both be storing the <b>same</b> value (x+1) back in x!</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
Thread 1: reads x, value is 7
Thread 1: add 1 to x, value is now 8
Thread 2: reads x, <b>value is 7</b>
Thread 1: stores 8 in x
Thread 2: adds 1 to x, value is now 8
Thread 2: <b>stores 8 in x</b>
</pre>

<p>Race conditions can be avoided by employing some sort of <b>locking</b> mechanism before the code that accesses the shared resource:</p>

{
   //lock x
   x = x + 1;

<p>Edit: I just downloaded the application and looked at the files. It does appear to have binaries for all 3 platforms in one directory. If your concern is in how to write apps that can be moved from machine to machine without losing settings, you should probably write all your configuration to a file in the same directory as the executable and not touch the Windows registry or create any dot directories in the home folder of the user that's running the program on Linux or Mac. And as far as creating a cross-distribution Linux binary, 32-bit POSIX/X11 would probably be the safest bet. I'm not sure what JungleDisk uses as I'm currently on a Mac.</p>

The library didn't have any GUI components, which made it easier.  We ended up abstracting out into dedicated source files any routine that was not consistent across platforms, and used #defines where appropriate in those source files.  This kept the code that was adjusted per platform isolated away from the main business logic of the library.  We also made extensive use of typedefs and our own dedicated types so that we could easily change them per platform if needed.  This made the port to 64-bit platforms fairly easy.</p>

This makes accurate recording of elapsed time pretty painless and about as accurate as you can get, which in turn improves FogBugz predictive powers in its evidence-based scheduling.

<p>@Linor: That's essentially what you would do after creating a Voronoi diagram. But instead of making a rectangular grid, you can choose dividing lines that closely match the lines of the Voronoi diagram (this way you will get fewer areas that cross dividing lines). If you recursively divide your Voronoi diagram in half along the best dividing line for each subdiagram, you can then do a tree search for each point you want to look up. This requires a bit of work up front but saves time later. Each lookup would be on the order of log N where N is the number of points. 16 comparisons is a lot better than 15,000!</p>

If you're only doing single country, or can exclude the poles, you can have a smaller map or higher resolution. For 15,000 points you probably have a much smaller map - I first sized it up as a first step to doing lat-lon to postcode searches, which needs higher resolution.

<pre><code>sudo gem install cheat

<pre><code>cheat gem

<p>That will <a href=""http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/gem/"" rel=""nofollow"">list out a ""man page""</a> written by users like you about the gem command.

<p>I should mention though that compiling from source is very easy and offers developers quite a bit of neat flexibility.  You can <a href=""http://www.nabble.com/Re:--SVN--Re:-Changes-for-Ruby-1.9-td19223651.html"" rel=""nofollow"">add a suffix</a> to the generated commands so that you can have standalone Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 builds both at the same time.  That can be very helpful for testing.</p>

<p>Finally, its always a danger to update an operating systems built in commands unless it occurs through an official update.  Installed applications may be expecting to a Ruby 1.8 in the standard location and crash if they meet an updated version.  Any updates you make should just not overwrite one that came with an OS.  (If any app crashes then its the fault of the app's developers for not specifying the absolute path to the OS version).</p>

For just getting started the emulator is very good. You're going to use the emulator during development most of the time anyway so if you're just figuring things out it is fine to use just that.

<p>If you know exactly what you want to build it might be a good idea to think about what hardware you're going to need as soon as possible.

Therefore non-temporal stores must be followed by an SFENCE instruction in order for their results to be seen by other processors in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>When data is produced and not (immediately) consumed again, the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance. This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon. This is especially true for large data structures, like matrices, which are filled and then used later. Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements, making caching of the writes ineffective.</p>

<p>For this and similar situations, processors provide support for non-temporal write operations. Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon, so there is no reason to cache it. These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it; instead, the new content is directly written to memory. </p>

<p>I have not used it in the last six months or so, but we did find it very useful for collaborating in a multimedia-style classroom, but like all media streaming, does require a decent broadband connection both on the server and client end.</p>

<p>One further issue we discovered with it was that to avoid a lot of messy firewall issues (especially at educational institutions) you need to run it on its own machine on port 80, so if it is running in collaboration with another website (such as Moodle), you need a separate machine for DimDim and for Moodle.</p>

<p>So far, to avoid a lot of technical issues that existed a year ago (but have probably been resolved), the project I was working on went with a hosted service at the time, but it is expected that it will end up running its own versions for control and cost reasons.</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Calling with an array of the parameter type, in which case the <code>params</code> keyword has no effect and the array is passed directly to the method:</p>

<pre><code>object[] array = new[] { ""1"", ""2"" };

// Foo receives the 'array' argument directly.
Foo( array );
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Or, calling with an extended list of arguments, in which case the compiler will automatically wrap the list of arguments in a temporary array and pass that to the method:</p>

<pre><code>// Foo receives a temporary array containing the list of arguments.
Foo( ""1"", ""2"" );

// This is equivalent to:
object[] temp = new[] { ""1"", ""2"" );
Foo( temp );
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<p>In order to pass in an object array to a method with a ""<code>params object[]</code>"" parameter, you can either:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Create a wrapper array manually and pass that directly to the method, as mentioned by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36350/c-how-to-pass-a-single-object-to-a-params-object#36360"">lassevk</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Foo( new object[] { array } );  // Equivalent to calling convention 1.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Or, cast the argument to <code>object</code>, as mentioned by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36350/c-how-to-pass-a-single-object-to-a-params-object#36367"">Adam</a>, in which case the compiler will create the wrapper array for you:</p>

<pre><code>Foo( (object)array );  // Equivalent to calling convention 2.
</code></pre>

<p><br/></p>

<p>However, if the goal of the method is to process multiple object arrays, it may be easier to declare it with an explicit ""<code>params object[][]</code>"" parameter. This would allow you to pass multiple arrays as arguments:</p>

<pre><code>void Foo( params object[][] arrays ) {
  foreach( object[] array in arrays ) {
    // process array
  }
}

...
Foo( new[] { ""1"", ""2"" }, new[] { ""3"", ""4"" } );

// Equivalent to:
object[][] arrays = new[] {
  new[] { ""1"", ""2"" },
  new[] { ""3"", ""4"" }
};
Foo( arrays );

<p>Although this was first published in 1936, the advice contained within is still as fresh and appropriate as ever. Don't be put off by the name. This isn't some underhand guide to having your way with unsuspecting victims, but rather common sense advice on how to get on with people, how to nurture relationships and make the most of yourself and your fellow man (and woman).</p>

<p>It is well known that technical folk (including programmers) are often thought of as not being terribly 'people oriented' (whether this is a justified stereotype or not is subject of another discussion) and so this book is an invaluable resource for teaching you the finer points of human interaction.</p>

<p>It's warm, heartfelt, sturdy, straightforward and timelessly written. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Really - <em>anything</em> will broaden your horizon. This does not only apply to programmers and developers. I think everyone would do better having an interest in something that you don't already spend 8-12 hours a day.</p>

<p>Personally, I sometimes feel like a <em>real world</em> idiot because my personal library of books on all kind of topics related to computers is growing and growing and I can never relax - I mean, I spend roughly 10 hours a day with them and then I am reading a book on design patterns before I go to bed. How sick is that? ;)</p>

<p>My current refuge is my newspaper subscription, and various other magazines I pick up every so often when I go by a news stand. Most of them have nothing to do with technology and programming. I made a habit going out for a coffee in the morning, taking the newspaper along and reading something else, or meeting friends and just chatting away.</p>

<p>So, just to make it more clear - I know that a newspaper or any magazine is not as current and up to date as a website. But this allows me to not read it on a screen and do something outside the usual.</p>

Are you saying that when you go from www.mysmallwebsite.com to www.myIsv.com/myWebSite/ then the PHP session is lost?</p>

<p>PHP recognizes the session with an ID (alpha-numeric hash generated on the server). The ID is passed from request to request using a cookie called PHPSESSID or something like that (you can view the cookies a websites sets with the help of your browser ... on Firefox you have Firebug + FireCookie and the wonderful Web Developer Toolbar ... with which you can view the list of cookies without a sweat).</p>

<p>So ... PHP is passing the session ID through the PHPSESSID cookie. But you can pass the session ID as a plain GET request parameters.</p>

<p>So, be careful trying to wrap an <code>Enumeration</code> as an <code>Iterable</code>. If someone passes me an <code>Iterable</code>, I will assume that I can call <code>iterator()</code> on it repeatedly, creating as many <code>Iterator</code> instances as I want, and iterating independently on each. A wrapped <code>Enumeration</code> will not fulfill this contract; don't let your wrapped <code>Enumeration</code> escape from your own code. (As an aside, I noticed that Java 7's <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/DirectoryStream.html""><code>DirectoryStream</code></a> violates expectations in just this way, and shouldn't be allowed to ""escape"" either.)</p>

<p><code>Enumeration</code> is like an <code>Iterator</code>, not an <code>Iterable</code>. A <code>Collection</code> is <code>Iterable</code>. An <code>Iterator</code> is not.</p>

<p>You can't do this:</p>

<pre><code>Vector&lt;X&gt; list = â¦
Iterator&lt;X&gt; i = list.iterator();
for (X x : i) {
    x.doStuff();

for (X x : i) {
    x.doStuff();
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is no <code>Enumerable</code> equivalent to <code>Iterable</code>. It could be added without breaking anything to work in for loops, but what would be the point? If you are able to implement this new <code>Enumerable</code> interface, why not just implement <code>Iterable</code> instead?</p>

<p>For applications that stay offline and create multiple rows before saving, a common practice is to continue counting backwards (-2, -3, -4) for each new row's identity. Then when they're saved, the server can replace them with the true ""next"" value from the table.</p>

<p>âCopy leftâ is the philosophy of the free software foundation requiring anything incorporating the licensed opens source code to also be licensed as open source.  That philosophy is regarded as poison by established companies that want to keep their products proprietary.</p>

<p>Aside from not having âcopy leftâ provisions, the Apache license specifically addresses the grant of rights from project contributors and it expressly addresses the fact that modern companies are typically made up for more than one legal entity (for example, a parent company and its subsidiaries).  Most open source licenses donât address these points.</p>

<p>Whatever license you choose, if you want your code to be âcorporate friendly,â in the sense that you want it to be incorporated into commercial, non-open source products, it is essential that you avoid GPL and other âcopy leftâ type licenses.  While it would be best to consult with your own lawyer before investing time or money in a project for which this is an important factor, a quick shorthand for licenses that are and are not âcopy leftâ can be found on the Free Software Foundationâs website.  They identify which licenses they donât find meet their standards as âcopy left.â  The ones FSF rejects are most likely the ones that will be corporate friendly in this sense.</p>

<p>(Although the question didnât ask this, it is worth mentioning that, with very few exceptions, even GPL and other âcopy leftâ type licenses are perfectly corporate friendly if they are only used internally by the commercial entities and not incorporated into their products.)</p>

40121,4050,2008-09-02T17:38:58Z,40090,20,"<p>Just to satisfy some curiosity:</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/csharpfaq/archive/2004/03/07/85556.aspx"">Why doesn't C# support default parameters?</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In languages such as C++, a default value can be included as part of the method declaration:</p>
  
  <p>void Process(Employee employee, bool bonus = false)</p>
  
  <p>This method can be called either with:</p>
  
  <p>a.Process(employee, true);</p>
  
  <p>or</p>
  
  <p>a.Process(employee);</p>
  
  <p>in the second case, the parameter bonus is set to false.</p>
  
  <p>C# doesn't have this feature.</p>
  
  <p>One reason we don't have this feature is related to a specific implementation of the feature. In the C++ world, when the user writes:</p>
  
  <p>a.Process(employee);</p>
  
  <p>the compiler generates</p>
  
  <p>a.process(employee, false);</p>
  
  <p>In other words, the compiler takes the default value that is specified in the method prototype and puts it into the method call - it's just as if the user wrote 'false' as the second parameter. There's no way to change that default value without forcing the user of the class to recompile, which is unfortunate.</p>
  
  <p>The overloading model works better in this respect. The framework author just defines two separate methods, and the single-parameter one calls the two-parameter method. This keeps the default value in the framework, where it can be modified if necessary.</p>
  
  <p>It would be possible for a compiler to take something like the C++ definition and produce the overloads, but there are a few issues with that approach.</p>
  
  <p>The first one is that the correlation between the code that the user writes and the code the compiler generates is less obvious. We generally try to limit magic when possible, as it makes it harder for programmers. The second issue has to do with things like XML doc comments and intellisense. The compiler would have to have special rules for how it generates doc comments for the overloaded methods, and intellisense would need to have smarts to collapse the overloaded methods into a single method.</p>
  
  <p>Writing overloads yourself is a bit less convenient, but we think it's an acceptable solution. </p>

<p>Most of the problems listed there were solved for VB.Net (specifically the intellisense and xml comments issues), meaning they're really red herrings-- <em>there is code available to the C# team that will solve the problem.</em>  </p>

<p>Another reason has to do with forcing a user of a class to re-compile, but that's a bit of a red herring, too.  If you <em>change</em> a default value in your framework class and the user does <em>not</em> have to recompile, you risk the user <em>not knowing that the default value changed.</em>  Now you have a potential bug in the code that doesn't show up until runtime.  In other words, the alternative of overloading the function is at least as bad.  Of course, this also presumes a specific implementation of the feature, but it's the implementation suggested in the faq.</p>

<p>Therefore you have to weigh the remaining reason (""try to limit the magic"") vs the fact (which they acknowledge) that writing the overloads is ""a bit less convenient"".  Personally, I say put the feature in, and let the programmer decide whether or not to use it.</p>

<p>There are other problems with GUIDs, you see GUIDs are not sequential, so inserts will be scattered all over the place, this causes page splits and index fragmentation</p>

<p>The thing that you have to concern yourself with is the human readable identifier.  Guids cannot be exchanged by people - can you imagine trying to confirm your order number over the phone if it is a guid?  So in an offline scenario you may still have to generate <strong>something</strong> - like a publisher (workstation/user) id and some sequence number, so the order number may be 123-5678 -.  </p>

<p>However this may not satisfy business requirements of having a sequential number.  In fact regulatory requirements can be and influence - some regulations (SOX maybe) require that invoice numbers are sequential.  In such cases it may be neccessary to generate a sort of proforma number which is fixed up later when the systems synchronise.  You may land up with tables having OrderId (Guid), OrderNo (int), ProformaOrderNo (varchar) - some complexity may creep in.</p>

<p>At least having guids as primary keys means that you don't have to do a whole lot of cascading updates when the sync does eventually happen - you simply update the human readable number.</p>

<p>So how is it that anyone can be at all confused by this, and believe that Java is pass by reference, or think they have an example of Java acting as pass by reference? The key point is that Java <strong>never</strong> provides direct access to the values of <em>objects themselves</em>, in <em>any</em> circumstances. The only access to objects is through a <em>reference</em> to that object. Because Java objects are <em>always</em> accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables <em>and method arguments</em> as being <em>objects</em>, when pedantically they are only <em>references to objects</em>. <strong>The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature.</strong></p>

<p>So, when calling a method</p>

<ul>
<li>For primitive arguments (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, etc.), the pass by value is <em>the actual value</em> of the primitive (for example, 3).</li>
<li>For objects, the pass by value is the value of <em>the reference to the object</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you have <code>doSomething(foo)</code> and <code>public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. }</code> the two Foos have copied <em>references</em> that point to the same objects.</p>

40523,4192,2008-09-02T20:25:37Z,40480,3038,"<p>Java is always <strong>pass-by-value</strong>. Unfortunately, they decided to call pointers references, thus confusing newbies. Because those <em>references</em> are passed by value.</p>

<p>It goes like this:</p>

    Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
    foo(aDog);

    if (aDog.getName().equals(""Max"")) { //true

    d = new Dog(""Fifi"");

<p>In this <a href=""http://ideone.com/oUEPbg"">example</a> <code>aDog.getName()</code> will still return <code>""Max""</code>. The value <code>aDog</code> within <code>main</code> is not overwritten in the function <code>foo</code> with the <code>Dog</code> <code>""Fifi""</code> as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the <code>aDog.getName()</code> in <code>main</code> would return <code>""Fifi""</code> after the call to <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>Likewise:</p>

<pre><code>Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
foo(aDog);
aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
public void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true
    d.setName(""Fifi"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>FiFi</code> is the dog's name after call to <code>foo(aDog)</code>.

<p>In general, Java has primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then Java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by reference, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>

<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>

<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.</p>

<p>Anyway here's a quick demo walkthrough of using the MultipleLookupField in a web part.</p>

<p>Create a team site. Add a few tasks to the task list. Also put a document in the Shared Documents library. Create a new column in the Shared Documents library; call it ""Related"", have it be a Lookup into the Title field of the Tasks list, and allow multiple values.</p>

<p>Now create a web part, do all the usual boilerplate and then add this:</p>

<pre><code>Label l;
MultipleLookupField mlf;

protected override void CreateChildControls()
{
    base.CreateChildControls();
    SPList list = SPContext.Current.Web.Lists[""Shared Documents""];
    if (list != null &amp;&amp; list.Items.Count &gt; 0)
    {
        LiteralControl lit = new LiteralControl(""Associate tasks to "" + 
                             list.Items[0].Name);
        this.Controls.Add(lit);

        mlf = new MultipleLookupField();
        mlf.ControlMode = SPControlMode.Edit;
        mlf.FieldName = ""Related"";
        mlf.ItemId = list.Items[0].ID;
        mlf.ListId = list.ID;
        mlf.ID = ""Related"";
        this.Controls.Add(mlf);

        Button b = new Button();
        b.Text = ""Change"";
        b.Click += new EventHandler(bClick);
        this.Controls.Add(b);

        l = new Label();
        this.Controls.Add(l);
    }

}

void bClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    l.Text = """";
    foreach (SPFieldLookupValue val in (SPFieldLookupValueCollection)mlf.Value)
    {
        l.Text += val.LookupValue.ToString() + "" "";
    }
    SPListItem listitem = mlf.List.Items[0];
    listitem[""Related""] = mlf.Value;
    listitem.Update();
    mlf.Value = listitem[""Related""];
}

protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnInit(e);
    EnsureChildControls();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Granted, this is borderline ridiculous -- everything is hard-coded, there is no error-handling at all, and it serves no useful purpose -- but it's only meant as a quick demo. Now build and deploy this web part and add an instance of it to your team site's homepage; it should allow you to get and set the tasks which are associated with the first document in the library.</p>

<p>The strange bit towards the end of the button Click handler, where we read a value from mlf.Value and then write it back again, appears to be required if you want the UI to stay in sync with the actual list values. Try omitting the last line of bClick to see what I mean. This has been driving me nuts for the last hour or so, and I'm hoping another commenter can come up with a better approach...</p>

I would recommend to read up on cryptography in general and then do some threat modeling. Some questions (by no means a comprehensive list) you should ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the module doing the encryption the one which needs to decrypt it (in this case use symmetric crypto) or will it send data to an other module (on an other machine) which will use it (in which case you should consider public-key crypto)</li>
<li>What do you want to protect against? Someone accessing the database but not having the sourcecode (in which case you can hardcode the encryption key directly into the source)? Someone sniffing your local network (you should consider transparent solutions like IPSec)? Someone stealing your server (it can happen even in data centers - in which case full disk encryption should be considered)?</li>
<li>Do you really need to keep the data? Can't you directly pass it to the credit card processor and erase it after you get the confirmation? Can't you store it locally at the client in a cookie or Flash LSO? If you store it at the client, make sure that you encrypt it at the server side before putting it in a cookie. Also, if you are using cookies, make sure that you make them http only.</li>
<li>Is it enough to compare the equality of the data (ie the data that the client has given me is the same data that I have)? If so, consider storing a hash of it. Because credit card numbers are relatively short and use a reduced set of symbols, a unique salt should be generated for each before hashing.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Later edit</em>: note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category (for example 3DES and AES - both being symmetric block cyphers) are of comparable strength. Most (commercial) systems are not broken because somebody bruteforced their encryption, but because their threat modelling was not detailed enough (or flat out they didn't have any). For example you can encrypt all the data, but if you happen to have a public facing web interface which is vulnerable to SQL injection, it won't help you much.</p>

<p>If the designer is not familiar with Smarty, I think it's almost the same as if you use the existing CodeIgniter templating system (which leaves everything to PHP actually). It also depends on the complexity of the project at hand.</p>

<p>You can also hook Smarty with Zend Framework.

<p>In my opinion it's almost the same, you can use pure PHP or Smarty as your template ""engine"", so it depends on the project. Also, compare a developer who has extensive experience and already has a library of view helpers so she uses pure PHP, versus a designer who doesn't know anything about PHP, but has extensive experience with Smarty. Sometimes decisions have to be based on who is going to do what.</p>

<p>This has two merits:</p>

<ol>
<li>To allow the user to single ""tables"" containing the data they expect rather requiring relatively non technical users to work out potentially complex joins (because the database is normalised)</li>
<li>It provides a means to allow some degree of ah hoc access without exposing the data or the structure to the end users.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even with non ad-hoc reporting its sometimes signicantly easier to provide a view to the reporting system that contains the relveant data, neatly separating production of data from presentation of same.</p>

<p>I usually prefer working with tables directly, especially for web applications where speed is a main concern. When accessing tables directly you have the chance to tweak your SQL-Queries to achieve the best performance. ""Precompiled""/cached working plans might be one advantage of views, but in many cases just-in-time compilation with all given parameters and where clauses in consideration will result in faster processing over all.</p>

<p>However that does not rule out views totally, if used adequately. For example you can use a view with the ""users"" table joined with the ""users_status"" table to get an textual explanation for each status - if you need it. However if you don't need the explanation: use the ""users"" table, not the view. As always: Use your brain!</p>

There is no obvious way of comparing these two collections without knowledge of what they are to be used for so a general purpose equals method makes no sense. </p>

43567,2676,2008-09-04T11:58:27Z,43320,213,"<p>Briefly:</p>

<ol>
<li>Always use transactions</li>
<li>Don't use <code>Close()</code>, instead wrap your calls on an <code>ISession</code> inside a <code>using</code> statement or <strong>manage the lifecycle of your ISession somewhere else</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>From <a href=""http://nhibernate.info/doc/nh/en/index.html#manipulatingdata-flushing"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From time to time the <code>ISession</code> will execute the SQL statements needed to synchronize the ADO.NET connection's state with the state of objects held in memory. This process, flush, occurs by default at the following points</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>from some invocations of <code>Find()</code> or <code>Enumerable()</code></li>
  <li>from <code>NHibernate.ITransaction.Commit()</code></li>
  <li>from <code>ISession.Flush()</code> </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The SQL statements are issued in the following order</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>all entity insertions, in the same order the corresponding objects were saved using <code>ISession.Save()</code></li>
  <li>all entity updates</li>
  <li>all collection deletions</li>
  <li>all collection element deletions, updates and insertions</li>
  <li>all collection insertions</li>
  <li>all entity deletions, in the same order the corresponding objects were deleted using <code>ISession.Delete()</code></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>(An exception is that objects using native ID generation are inserted when they are saved.)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Except when you explicity <code>Flush()</code>, there are absolutely no guarantees about when the Session executes the ADO.NET calls, only the order in which they are executed</strong>. However, NHibernate does guarantee that the <code>ISession.Find(..)</code> methods will never return stale data; nor will they return the wrong data.</p>
  
  <p>It is possible to change the default behavior so that flush occurs less frequently. The <code>FlushMode</code> class defines three different modes: only flush at commit time (and only when the NHibernate <code>ITransaction</code> API is used), flush automatically using the explained routine, or never flush unless <code>Flush()</code> is called explicitly. The last mode is useful for long running units of work, where an <code>ISession</code> is kept open and disconnected for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<p>Also refer to <a href=""http://nhibernate.info/doc/nh/en/index.html#manipulatingdata-endingsession"">this section</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ending a session involves four distinct phases:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>flush the session</li>
  <li>commit the transaction</li>
  <li>close the session</li>
  <li>handle exceptions </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Flushing the Session</h2>
  
  <p>If you happen to be using the <code>ITransaction</code> API, you don't need to worry about this step. It will be performed implicitly when the transaction is committed. Otherwise you should call <code>ISession.Flush()</code> to ensure that all changes are synchronized with the database.</p>
  
  <h2>Committing the database transaction</h2>
  
  <p>If you are using the NHibernate ITransaction API, this looks like:</p>

<pre><code>tx.Commit(); // flush the session and commit the transaction
</code></pre>
  
  <p>If you are managing ADO.NET transactions yourself you should manually <code>Commit()</code> the ADO.NET transaction.</p>

<pre><code>sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();
</code></pre>
  
  <p>If you decide not to commit your changes:</p>

<pre><code>tx.Rollback();  // rollback the transaction
</code></pre>
  
  <p>or:</p>

<pre><code>currentTransaction.Rollback();
</code></pre>
  
  <p>If you rollback the transaction you should immediately close and discard the current session to ensure that NHibernate's internal state is consistent.</p>
  
  <h2>Closing the ISession</h2>
  
  <p>A call to <code>ISession.Close()</code> marks the end of a session. The main implication of Close() is that the ADO.NET connection will be relinquished by the session.</p>

<pre><code>tx.Commit();
sess.Close();

sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();
sess.Close();
</code></pre>
  
  <p>If you provided your own connection, <code>Close()</code> returns a reference to it, so you can manually close it or return it to the pool. Otherwise <code>Close()</code> returns it to the pool. </p>

<h3>Original Answer (for pre-8.4 PostgreSQL):</h3>

<p>There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it's not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations <a href=""http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-novice/2003-09/msg00177.php"">the same example</a>:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE AGGREGATE textcat_all(
  basetype    = text,

  initcond    = ''
);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-createaggregate.html"">Here is the <code>CREATE AGGREGATE</code> documentation.</a></p>

<p>In order to get the "", "" inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the ""textcat"" above. Here is one I put together but haven't tested (<strong><em>update:</strong> tested on 8.3.12 and working fine</em>):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION commacat(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$

</blockquote>

<p>So as far as I know, any asp.net ajax components within the update panel are disposed to prevent memory leaks, but anything else in there will just be replaced with the html received.</p>

<p>So if you don't have any asp.net ajax components in the target container for the response, it would be basically the same as an inner html replacement with any other js framework / ajax request, so i would say that it's just the how the browser handles this, rather than asp.net ajax causing this.</p>

I've seen similar complaints online (especially where you are dumb enough to access an Ajax website via Citrix), but it doesn't make me feel much better that this is the intended behavior.</p>

<p>I'm wondering now if anyone has come up with a clever workaround.  We also have a client app where we are using the .NET BrowserControl to access these websites, rather than just straight IE7, so if anyone knows a secret API call (<em>FreeStaleDomObjectsFTW()</em>) we can utilize from that end of the stack, that would be useful as well.</p>

<p>In this case, depending on the complexity of the loop body, the compiler might be able to replace the loop with inline calls.  I have no idea if the .NET compiler does this, and it's of limited utility if the size of the enumerable type is dynamic.</p>

<p>One situation where <code>foreach</code> might perform better is with data structures like a linked list where random access means traversing the list; the enumerator used by <code>foreach</code> will probably iterate one item at a time, making each access O(1) and the full loop O(n), but calling the indexer means starting at the head and finding the item at the right index; O(N) each loop for O(n^2).</p>

<p>Personally I don't usually worry about it and use <code>foreach</code> any time I need all items and don't care about the index of the item.  If I'm not working with all of the items or I really need to know the index, I use <code>for</code>.  The only time I could see it being a big concern is with structures like linked lists.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 &lt;= i &lt; n and call this T (""travel"") and set R (""rise"") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.</p></li>
<li><p>Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)</p></li>
<li><p>Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).</p></li>
<li><p>Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 &lt; x1 &lt; x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.
Best match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.</p>

<p>I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.</p>

<p>Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.

<p>So it looks like my hopes that there's some kind of cheap way to enable Vista theming on XP are dashed.  The only way to do it is to manually draw the non-client area of your window.  I believe <a href=""http://geekswithblogs.net/kobush/articles/CustomBorderForms.aspx"">something like this</a> is probably the right track, since it lets Windows handle the non-client stuff like moving and resizing the window.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>pychecker</strong>: It crashes frequently, most of the runs I tried resulted in Errors that originated in the pychecker code (eg: AttributeError or IndexError: list index out of range were the most common).  For some reason I had to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable before it would even run on any of the app code, and the documentation is very sparse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pyflakes</strong>: 'pyflakes --help' throws a TypeError -- erm... Documentation is also very sparse, and pyflakes is very forgiving (as far as I can tell, it only reports compile errors, warnings, redefinitions, and some concerns about imports--such as unused and wildcards).  pyflakes also seems to repeat itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused<br>
      eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused<br>
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
      eventlist/views.py:59: 'authenticate' imported but unused<br>
      eventlist/views.py:61: redefinition of unused 'login' from
  line 59<br>
      eventlist/views.py:5: 'from eventlist.models import *' used;
  unable to detect undefined names <br>
     eventlist/views.py:4: 'Http404' imported but unused</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>pylint</strong>: This seems to be the most capable of the tools suggested.  It has the best documentation.  LogiLab provides a tutorial, pylint has a help screen, and there is a (broken) link to a user manual, which would be extremely helpful.  There are some issues with applying pylint to django, since pylint doesn't know about the django classes (such as models.Model).  This means that a fair number of otherwise valuable errors are generated about missing class fields.  eg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E:105:get_events_by_tag: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parsing these out automatically will be very difficult without some additional knowledge of the classes in use.  I'm not sure adding that is feasible, but it does seem likely that pylint is capable of dealing with this in the ""right"" way.  (I probably just need to point it to the django source, but there are no command line params that look likely, and, as mentioned earlier, the user manual is inaccessible.)</p></li>

<p>This goes well with the Template Method design pattern.  I have an interface that says ""I perform this service.""  I then have a class that implements that interface.  But, what if performing that service relies on context that the base class doesn't know about (and shouldn't know about)?  What happens is that the base class provides virtual methods, which are either protected or private, and these virtual methods are the hooks for subclasses to provide the piece of information or action that the base class does not know and cannot know.  Meanwhile, the base class can contain code that is common for all the child classes.  These subclasses would be sealed because they are meant to accomplish that one and only one concrete implementation of the service.</p>

<p>Can you make the argument that these subclasses should be further subclassed to enhance them?

<p>I was going to say that, but you beat me to it!  Anyways, I just wanted to add that there is also the -R option:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -R 8022:myinsideserver:22 paul@myoutsideserver
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is what machine you are connecting to/from.  My boss showed me this trick not too long ago, and it is definitely really nice to know... we were behind a firewall and needed to give external access to a machine... he got around it by ssh -R to another machine that was accessible... then connections to that machine were forwarded into the machine behind the firewall, so you need to use -R or -L based on which machine you are on and which you are ssh-ing to.</p>

<p>Also, I'm pretty sure you are fine to use a regular user as long as the port you are forwarding (in this case the 8022 port) is not below the restricted range (which I think is 1024, but I could be mistaken), because those are the ""reserved"" ports.  It doesn't matter that you are forwarding it to a ""restricted"" port because that port is not being opened (the machine is just having traffic sent to it through the tunnel, it has no knowledge of the tunnel), the 8022 port IS being open and so is restricted as such.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just remember, the tunnel is only open so long as the initial ssh remains open, so if it times out or you exit it, the tunnel will be closed.</p>

45278,2938,2008-09-05T05:33:22Z,45230,4,"<p>(In this example, I am assuming port 2222 will go to your internal host.  $externalip and $internalip are the ip addresses or hostnames of the visible and internal machine, respectively.)</p>

<p>You have a couple of options, depending on how permanent you want the proxying to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some sort of TCP proxy.  On Linux, the basic idea is that <i>before</i> the incoming packet is processed, you want to <i>change its destination</i>&mdash;i.e. prerouting destination NAT:</p>

<p><code>iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 -d $externalip --dport 2222 --sport 
1024:65535 -j DNAT --to $internalip:22</code></p></li>
<li><p>Using SSH to establish temporary port forwarding.  From here, you have two options again:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Transparent proxy, where the client thinks that your visible host (on port 2222) is just a normal SSH server and doesn't realize that it is passing through.  While you lose some fine-grained control, you get convenience (especially if you want to use SSH to forward VNC or X11 all the way to the inner host).</p>

<ul>
<li>From the internal machine: <code>ssh -g -R 2222:localhost:22 $externalip</code></li>
<li>Then from the outside world: <code>ssh -p 2222 $externalip</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that the ""internal"" and ""external"" machines do not have to be on the same LAN.  You can port forward all the way around the world this way.</p></li>
<li><p>Forcing login to the external machine first.  This is true ""forwarding,"" not ""proxying""; but the basic idea is this: You force people to log in to the external machine (so you control on who can log in and when, and you get logs of the activity), and from there they can SSH through to the inside.  It sounds like a chore, but if you <i>set up simple shell scripts on the external machine with the names of your internal hosts, coupled with password-less SSH keypairs</i> then it is very straightforward for a user to log in.  So:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the external machine, you make a simple script, <code>/usr/local/bin/internalhost</code> which simply runs <code>ssh $internalip</code></li>
<li>From the outside world, users do: <code>ssh $externalip internalhost</code> and once they log in to the first machine, they are immediately forwarded through to the internal one.</li>
</ul>

<p><p><p>Another advantage to this approach is that people don't get key management problems, since running two SSH services on one IP address will make the SSH client angry.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
</ul>
FYI, if you want to SSH to a server and you do not want to worry about keys, do this</p>

<pre><code>ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
</code></pre>

<p>I have an alias in my shell called ""nossh"", so I can just do <code>nossh somehost</code> and it will ignore all key errors.  Just understand that you are ignoring security information when you do this, so there is a theoretical risk.</p>

<p>Much of this information is from a talk I gave at Barcamp Bangkok all about fancy SSH tricks.  You can see <a href=""http://www.proven-corporation.com/static/ssh/"" rel=""nofollow"">my slides</a>, but I recommend the <a href=""http://www.proven-corporation.com/static/ssh/ssh.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">text version</a> as the S5 slides are kind of buggy.  Check out the section called ""Forward Anything: Simple Port Forwarding"" for info.  There is also information on creating a SOCKS5 proxy with OpenSSH.  Yes, you can do that.  OpenSSH is awesome like that.</p>

<p>(Finally, if you are doing a lot of traversing into the internal network, consider setting up a VPN.  It sounds scary, but OpenVPN is quite simple and runs on all OSes.  I would say it's overkill just for SSH; but once you start port-forwarding through your port-forwards to get VNC, HTTP, or other stuff happening; or if you have lots of internal hosts to worry about, it can be simpler and more maintainable.)</p>

45440,1483,2008-09-05T08:45:23Z,45400,61,"<p>I would use Subversion (in fact I use it) [<strong>update</strong>: Jul 2014 -- I use Git -- see end of the answer].
SVN is:</p>

<ul>
<li>free,  </li>
<li>good enough (see disadvantages below),  </li>
<li>simple,  </li>
<li>works fine on Windows (and Linux too), </li>

</ul>

<p>I would <strong>strongly</strong> recommended separate machine to source control server. At best somewhere <em>on the cloud</em>. Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't lost your source control repositories if your development box dies.</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about maintenance of one more box.</li>

<h1>Disadvantages of SVN</h1>

<p>I am using SVN on Windows machine for about 5 years and found that SVN has a few disadvantages :).</p>

<h2>It is slow on large repositories</h2>

<p>SVN (or its client -- TortoiseSVN) has one <strong>big</strong> disadvantage -- it terrible slow (while updating or committing) on large (thousands of files) repositories unless you have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive"" rel=""nofollow"">SSD</a> drive.</p>

<h2>Merging can be difficult</h2>

<p>Many people complain about how hard merging is with SVN.</p>

<p>I do merging for about 4 years (including about 2 years in CVS -- that was terrible, but doable) and about 2 years with SVN.</p>

<p>And personally I don't find it hard -- on the other hand -- any merge is easy after merging branches in CVS :).</p>

<p>I do merge of large repository (two repositories in fact) once a week and rarely I have conflicts which are hard to solve (most of conflicts are solved automatically with <em>diff</em> software which I use).</p>

<p>However in case of project of a few developers merging should not be problem at all if you keep a few simple rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>merge changes often,</li>
<li>avoid active development in various branches simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Added in July 2011</h2>

<p>Many devs recommended <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control_system"" rel=""nofollow"">Distributed Version Control</a> like <a href=""http://git-scm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Git</a> or <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mercurial</a>.</p>

<p>From <strong>single developer</strong> perspective there are only a few important advantages of DVCS over SVN:</p>

<ul>
<li>DVCS can be faster.</li>
<li>You can commit to local repository without access to central one.</li>
<li>DVCS is hot thing and fancy to use/learn (if someone pay for your learning).</li>
</ul>

<p>And I don't think merging is a problem in case of single developer.</p>

<p>Joel Spolsky wrote <a href=""http://hginit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorial about Mercurial</a> which is definitively worth to read.</p>

<p>So, despite of many advantages of DVCS I would stay with SVN if merging or speed is not a problem.</p>

<p>Or try Mercurial, which according to <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/995636/popularity-of-git-mercurial-bazaar-vs-which-to-recommend"">this</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2550091/best-support-now-on-windows-mercurial-or-git"">this</a> SO questions, is better supported (in July 2011) on Windows.</p>

<h2>Added in July 2014</h2>

<p>For about a year I use Git (Git Bash mainly) for my pet-projects (i.e. solving Euler problems) and local branches for each Euler problem are really nice feature -- exactly as it is described as advantage of DVCS. </p>

<p>Today Git tooling on Windows is much, much better then 2 or more years ago.
You can use remote repo (like GitHub or ProjectLocker and many others) to keep 
copy of your project away from your workstation with no extra effort/money.</p>

<p>However I use GUI client only to looks at diffs (and sometimes to choose files to commit),
so it's better to not afraid of command line -- it's really nice.</p>

<p>So as of today I would go with Git.</p>

<p>First up, that other server - what happens if your machine dies? the house burns down? etc. Having it on another machine is a good idea from a redundancy point of view.</p>

<p>The second one is WHAT:</p>

<p>If you are very familiar with visual source(un)safe, think about SourceGearVault. It's VERY nice, very fast, and very much a vastly improved ""clone"" of VSS (ie works the same way from the users POV, not under the hood). Needs SQL server and windows tho (it's .NET + SQL server). Free for 1 user.</p>

<p>Of you are not, then I suggest you do one of two things:</p>

<p>First, get VisualSVN. It's great, works with VS2008 really well.
Second, if you MUST run it locally, get VisualSVN server (free!). Make sure you have a good backup plan. Runs on XP/2003/2008/Vista etc.It's just Apache + SVN, under the hood, so it just saves you on the setup - took me 5 mins to install and have it running.</p>

<p>OR, and I prefer this one:</p>

<p>go somewhere like Unfuddle, Dreamhost etc, and get hosting for SVN. It's private, it's fast, and most of all - it's OFFSITE. My dreamhsot account, with something crazy like 500GB of storage and 1-2TB of transfer/month costs about $6/month! There are others which do SVN hosting + bug tracking etc. Look around.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the bootloader takes the machine code of the kernel, puts it in memory, and jumps to it.  You can put any machine code in the kernel that you want, but most C programs expect an OS so you'll need to tell your compiler that it won't have all that, or the bootloader has to create some of it.</p>

<p>The kernel then does all the heavy lifting, and I suspect it's the example kernel you want.  But there's a long way to go between having a kernel that says, ""Hello world"" to having a kernel that loads a command interpretor, provides disk services, and loads and manages programs.</p>

<p>You might want to consider subscribing to ACM to get access to their older literature - there are lots of articles in the late 80's and early 90's in early computing magazines about how to <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=87073.87079"" rel=""nofollow"">create alternative OSs</a>.  There are likely books that are out of print from this era as well.  You might be able to get the same information for free by looking up the indexes of those magazines (which are available on that site - click ""index"" near the magazine name) and then asking around for people with a copy.</p>

<p>Lastly, I know that usenet is dead (for so sayeth the prophets of internet doom) but you'll find that many of the craggy old experts from that era still live there.  You should search google groups (they have dejanews's old repository) and I expect you'll find many people asking the same questions a decade or 1.5 ago that you're asking now.  You may even run across Linus Torvalds' many queries for help as he was developing linux originally.

<p>In that case, in order to guarantee uniqueness you'd have to use some sort of big integer representation.  I doubt that doing comparisons on big integers would be substantially faster than doing string comparisons in the first place.  I'll second what other's have said here, use some sort of hash, then in the event of a hash match check the original strings to weed out any collisions.</p>

<p>In any case, If your strings are around 10 characters, I doubt that comparing, say, a bunch of 32 bit hashes will be all that much faster than direct string comparisons.  I think you have to ask yourself if it's it really worth the additional complexity.</p>

46247,2915,2008-09-05T16:36:00Z,46160,2,"<p>At the end of the day, a single alphanumeric character has at least 36 possible values.  If you include punctuation, lower case, etc then you can easily pass 72 possible values.</p>

<p>A non-colliding number that allows you to quickly compare strings would necessarily grow exponentially with the length of the string.</p>

<p>So you <em>first</em> must decide on the longest string you are expecting to compare.  Assuming it's N characters in length, and assuming you ONLY need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an integer representation that can be as high as
36^N</p>

<p>For a string of length 25 (common name field) then you end up needing a binary number with  130 bits.</p>

<p>If you compose that into 32 bit numbers, you'll need 4.  Then you can compare each number (four integer compares should take no time, compared to walking the string).  I would recommend a big number library, but for this specialized case I'm pretty sure you can write your own and get better performance.</p>

<p>If you want to handle 72 possible values per character (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, punctuation...) and you need 10 characters, then you'll need 62 bits - two 32 bit integers (or one 64 bit if you're on a system that supports 64 bit computing)</p>

<p>If, however, you are not able to restrict the numbers in the string (ie, could be any of the 256 letters/numbers/characters/etc) and you can't define the size of the string, then comparing the strings directly is the only way to go, but there's a shortcut.</p>

<p>Cast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array, and compare the string 4 bytes at a time (or 64 bits/8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor).  This means that a 100 character string only requires 25 compares maximum to find which is greater.</p>

<p>You may need to re-define the character set (and convert the strings) so that the characters with higher precedence are assigned values closer to 0, and lower precedence values closer to 255 (or vice versa, depending on how you are comparing them).</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Then, write handlers for the text field's focus events, modifying the fields contents and color based when focus is gained and lost.  Here's some pseudocode (sorry, it's totally not C# code.  I have Actionscript on the brain right now):</p>

<pre><code>TextInput myInput;
boolean showingHint = true;

myInput.text = ""Search Terms"";
myInput.color = 0xcccccc;

myInput.onFocusGained = function() {
  if(showingHint) {
    myInput.text = """";
    myInput.color = 0x000000;
    showingHint = false;

    myInput.text = ""Search Terms"";
    myInput.color = 0xcccccc;
    showingHint = true;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, you only want to change the text on focus lost if the user hasn't manually changed the text.  Use a separate boolean to track if you're showing the hint or not so you can differentiate between the user manually typing your ""hint"" text as actual content.  Similarly, you only want to clear the contents of the input box if the hint is being displayed so you don't get rid of user input accidentally.</p>

Do not expect to much from JRuby's performance. In interpreted mode, it seems to be somewhere in the range of C Ruby. JIT mode <em>might</em> be faster, but only in theory. In practice, we tried JIT mode on Glassfish for a decently-sized Rails application on a medium-sized server (dual core, 8GB RAM). And the truth is, the JITting took so <em>freakingly</em> much time, that the server needed 20-30 minutes before it answered the first request. Memory usage was astronomic, profiling did not work because the whole system grinded to halt with a profiler attached.</p>

<p>Bottom line: JRuby has its merits (multithreading, solid platform, easy Java integration), but given that interpreted mode is the only mode that worked for us in practice, it may be expected to be no better performance-wise than C Ruby.</p>

<p>We first created an abstraction layer that allowed us to ""slot in"" any reasonable database connection (in our case, we simply supported a single ODBC-type connection).</p>

<p>Once this was in place, we were then able to do something like this in our code (we work in C++, but I'm sure you get the idea):</p>

<p>GetDatabase().ExecuteSQL( ""INSERT INTO foo ( blah, blah )"" )</p>

<p>At normal run time, GetDatabase() would return an object that fed all our sql (including queries), via ODBC directly to the database.</p>

<p>We then started looking at in-memory databases - the best by a long way seems to be SQLite. (<a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/index.html"">http://www.sqlite.org/index.html</a>).  It's remarkably simple to set up and use, and allowed us subclass and override GetDatabase() to forward sql to an in-memory database that was created and destroyed for every test performed.</p>

<p>We're still in the early stages of this, but it's looking good so far, however we do have to make sure we create any tables that are required and populate them with test data - however we've reduced the workload somewhat here by creating a generic set of helper functions that can do a lot of all this for us.</p>

<p>Overall, it has helped immensely with our TDD process, since making what seems like quite innocuous changes to fix certain bugs can have quite strange affects on other (difficult to detect) areas of your system - due to the very nature of sql/databases.</p>

<p>Obviously, our experiences have centred around a C++ development environment, however I'm sure you could perhaps get something similar working under PHP/Python.</p>

  <p>Bigger C++ projects I've seen hardly used more than one namespace (e.g. boost library).</p>

<p>Actually boost uses tons of namespaces, typically every part of boost has its own namespace for the inner workings and then may put only the public interface in the top-level namespace boost.</p>

<p>Personally I think that the larger a code-base becomes, the more important namespaces become, even within a single application (or library). At work we put each module of our application in its own namespace.</p>

<p>Another use (no pun intended) of namespaces that I use a lot is the anonymous namespace:</p>

<pre><code>namespace {

}
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically the same as:</p>

48008,268,2008-09-07T01:26:58Z,41590,49,"<p>Don't listen to every people telling you that namespaces are just name-spaces.</p>

<p>They are important because they are considered by the compiler to apply the interface principle. Basically, it can be explained by an example:</p>

<pre><code>namespace ns {

class A
{
};

void print(A a)
{
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to print an A object, the code would be this one:</p>

<pre><code>ns::A a;
print(a);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we didn't explicitly mention the namespace when calling the function. This is the interface principle: C++ consider a function taking a type as an argument as being part of the interface for that type, so no need to specify the namespace because the parameter already implied the namespace.</p>

<p>Now why this principle is important? Imagine that the class A author did not provide a print() function for this class. You will have to provide one yourself. As you are a good programmer, you will define this function in your own namespace, or maybe in the global namespace.</p>

<pre><code>namespace ns {

class A
{
};

}

void print(A a)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>And your code can start calling the print(a) function wherever you want. Now imagine that years later, the author decides to provide a print() function, better than yours because he knows the internals of his class and can make a better version than yours.</p>

<p>Then C++ authors decided that his version of the print() function should be used instead of the one provided in another namespace, to respect the interface principle. And that this ""upgrade"" of the print() function should be as easy as possible, which means that you won't have to change every call to the print() function. That's why ""interface functions"" (function in the same namespace as a class) can be called without specifying the namespace in C++.</p>

<p>And that's why you should consider a C++ namespace as an ""interface"" when you use one and keep in mind the interface principle.</p>

<p>If you want better explanation of this behavior, you can refer to the book <a href=""http://books.google.fr/books?id=mT7E5gDuW_4C&amp;dq=exceptional+C%2B%2B&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=AXUPz0dWnW&amp;sig=DAib0u-zXuY3lGCCUFPtzI33pCQ&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA119,M1"">Exceptional C++ from Herb Sutter</a></p>

<p>You might be able to use this straight up, or you might have to preprocess it and either remove the code that was not executed, or add a new notation on each line that tells whether it was executed (most tools will only show path information at control points):</p>

<p>You should be able to form a regex that matches only when the first column contains a T, F, or x so you can capture all the control statements executed and lines executed.</p>

<p>Sometimes you'll only get coverage information at each control point, which then requires you to parse the C file and mark the execute lines yourself.  Not as easy, but not impossible either.</p>

<p>One day I finally realized that all these books were trying to do was prevent me from making mistakes ... which is exactly the opposite of how me, and most people learn.  <em>Smart</em> people make mistakes, and fail, quite frequently, but what makes them different is that they <em>learn</em> from their mistakes.  How could I learn when the books I was reading were preventing my from some <em>good</em> life lessons?</p>

<p>So from that point on I stopped reading non-technical books ... save for the ones that related to technical management .. which there aren't many.  Instead I started reading biographies on business owners, like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer, Larry Ellison and so on.  I learned more from these brillant, crazy, egocentric, often times failures that I learned from any of the business books I previously read!  </p>

<p>That is where I would start ... read books from people who are successes and failures in the vertical industries you are interested in ... instead of some author who is speaking from second-hand experience.  </p>

<p>With that aside, if I had to recommend some non-technical books, I would have to say these are a couple of my <em>classics</em>:</p>

<li>Acres of Diamonds by Russell H. Conwell </li>
<li>Obvious Adams: The Story of a Successful Businessman by Robert R. Updegraff</li>
<li>The Art of War by Sun Tzu</li>

The simplest solution, if your backend is FSFS (the default on recent versions), is to make a filesystem copy of the entire repository folder.</p>

<p>If you have a Berkley DB backend, if you're not sure of what your backend is, or if you're changing SVN version numbers, you're going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository.  Using <code>svnadmin dump</code> will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system.  Then you can create the new (empty) repository and use <code>svnadmin load</code>, which will essentially replay all the commits along with its metadata (author, timestamp, etc).</p>

<p>You can read more about the dump/load process here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate"">http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate</a></p>

<p>Also, if you do <code>svnadmin load</code>, make sure you use the <code>--force-uuid</code> option, or otherwise people are going to have problems switching to the new repository.  Subversion uses a UUID to identify the repository internally, and it won't let you switch a working copy to a different repository.</p>

<p>If you don't have filesystem access, there may be other third party options out there (or you can write something) to help you migrate: essentially you'd have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository, and then fix up the metadata afterwards.  You'll need the pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hook scripts in place to do this, which sort of assumes filesystem access, so YMMV.  Or, if you don't want to keep the history, you can use your working copy to import into the new repository.  But hopefully this isn't the case.</p>

49512,5168,2008-09-08T11:33:41Z,49510,70,"<p>There are four steps to making an app that can act as the default web browser. The first three steps allow your app to act as a role handler for the relevant URL schemes (HTTP and HTTPS) and the final step makes it the default role handler for those schemes.</p>

<p><strong>1) Add the URL schemes your app can handle to your application's info.plist file</strong></p>

<p>To add support for <code>http://</code> and <code>https://</code> you'd need to add the following to your application's info.plist file. This tells the OS that your application is capable of handling HTTP and HTTP URLs.</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;http URL&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;array&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;http&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;Secure http URL&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;array&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;https&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2) Write an URL handler method</strong></p>

<p>This method will be called by the OS when it wants to use your application to open a URL. It doesn't matter which object you add this method to, that'll be explicitly passed to the Event Manager in the next step. The URL handler method should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)getUrl:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)event 
    withReplyEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)replyEvent
{
  // Get the URL
  NSString *urlStr = [[event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject] 
    stringValue];

  //TODO: Your custom URL handling code here
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3) Register the URL handler method</strong></p>

<p>Next, tell the event manager which object and method to call when it wants to use your app to load an URL. In the code here I'm passed <code>self</code> as the event handler, assuming that we're calling <code>setEventHandler</code> from the same object that defines the <code>getUrl:withReplyEvent:</code> method.</p>

<p>You should add this code somewhere in your application's initialisation code.</p>

<pre><code>NSAppleEventManager *em = [NSAppleEventManager sharedAppleEventManager];
[em 
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:kInternetEventClass 
  andEventID:kAEGetURL];
</code></pre>

<p>Some applications, including early versions of Adobe AIR, use the alternative WWW!/OURL AppleEvent to request that an application opens URLs, so to be compatible with those applications you should also add the following:</p>

<pre><code>[em
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:'WWW!' 
  andEventID:'OURL'];
</code></pre>

<p><strong>4) Set your app as the default browser</strong></p>

<p>Everything we've done so far as told the OS that your application is <em>a browser</em>, now we need to make it <em>the default browser</em>.</p>

<p>We've got to use the Launch Services API to do this. In this case we're setting our app to be the default role handler for HTTP and HTTPS links:</p>

<pre><code>CFStringRef bundleID = (CFStringRef)[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier];
OSStatus httpResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""http""), bundleID);
OSStatus httpsResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""https""), bundleID);
//TODO: Check httpResult and httpsResult for errors
</code></pre>

<p>(It's probably best to ask the user's permission before changing their default browser.)</p>

<p><strong>Custom URL schemes</strong></p>

<p>It's worth noting that you can also use these same steps to handle your own custom URL schemes. If you're creating a custom URL scheme it's a good idea to base it on your app's bundle identifier to avoid clashes with other apps. So if your bundle ID is <code>com.example.MyApp</code> you should consider using <code>x-com-example-myapp://</code> URLs.</p>

<p>The only complications are addressing more than 4GB of memory space, dealing with pieces of code you can't cross-compile to a 32-bit architecture (64 bit object files for which you have no source, etc), and general 64 bit migration issues (platform specific code such as checking for 0xFFFFFFFF instead of -1)</p>

  <p>How disabled elements are rendered depends on the user agent. For example, some user agents ""gray out"" disabled menu items, button labels, etc. In this example, the INPUT element is disabled. Therefore, it cannot receive user input nor will its value be submitted with the form.</p>

<p>While this specific case isn't specified, my reading of this says that the actual rendering of a 'selected' 'disabled' element is left up to the browser.  As long as the user cannot select it then it's working as standard.  It does say that a script can act upon the element, so it is possible for Javascript to set a disabled option as selected (or disable a selected option).  This isn't contrary to the standards, but on form submission, that option's value couldn't be the selected value.  The select list would (I assume) have to have an empty value in this case.</p>

49880,3043,2008-09-08T15:02:55Z,49870,5,"<p>There are 4 basic ways to synchronize threads in .Net:</p>

<ul>
<li>BackgroundWorker control</li>
<li>WaitHandles</li>
<li>Callback functions</li>
<li>polling an ASyncResult object</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally you want to start at the top of that list and work down.  That means first look and see if a backgroundworker control is appropriate to the situation.  However, it pretty much assumes windows forms and that you're only spawning one new thread.</p>

<p>So next try waithandles.  Waithandles are good for coordinating several threads together.   You can kick them all off and wait for them all to finish, or if you want to keep a certain number active you keep waiting for just one and spawning the next when it finishes.  Or maybe you know one thread will finish much sooner, so you can wait for it to finish, do a little bit of work, and then wait for the rest to finish.</p>

<p>Waithandles might seem like a bit much if, say, you're only spawning one additional thread and you don't want to block until it's finished.  Then you might use a callback, so that the function you designate will be called as soon as the thread completes.</p>

<p>Finally, if and only if for some reason none of the above will work you can fall back to polling.</p>

<p>I can think of 5 different ways to get a new thread in .Net, also roughly in order:</p>

<ul>
<li>OS created, normally as the result of winforms event (including the BackgoundWorker).</li>
<li>Obj.Begin___()/End____().  Certain CLR classes already have these asynchronous methods defined for you, and obviously you want to use them when they're available.</li>
<li>ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem().  Use this most of the time to create your own threads.</li>
<li>Delegate.BeginInvoke()/EndInvoke().  You can wrap any method this way.</li>
<li>Thread.Start().  You <em>could</em> do it this way, but I read something recently (don't have the link now) that if QueueUserWorkItem won't work the delegate method is probably better.</li>

49957,2257,2008-09-08T15:37:41Z,49950,5,"<p>If a class has a Dispose method the best practice is to call it. the reason
behind that is that Dispose runs when called, whereas setting the object to
null simply adds a entry to the Finalize queue in GC, and we cannot
determine when GC will run.</p>

<p>There is no performance benefit in implementing the Dispose method on types that use only managed resources (such as arrays) because they are automatically reclaimed by the garbage collector. Use the Dispose method primarily on managed objects that use native resources and on COM objects that are exposed to the .NET Framework. Managed objects that use native resources (such as the FileStream class) implement the IDisposable interface.</p>

<p>An elegant means of inoking Dispose that have adopted is using the ""using"" construct. For those of you who may not be familiar with the construct, it provide a means to implicity invoke Dispose() on an instance that implements IDisposable even if an exception is thrown durring the operation. The following is an example of the using construct: </p>

<pre><code>using(DisposableClass dc = new DisposableClass()) 
{ 
   dc.PerformActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
   dc.PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the previous example, if an exception was thrown in the PerformActionOnUmanagedResources() method, although the PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources() method would not be processed, the using block will still implicity invoke the Dispose method on dc ensuring the realese of any unmanaged resources.</p>

<p>The garbage collector looks for rooted objects, and circular dependencies don't prevent collection if neither object is rooted.</p>

<p>There is a caveat: if object A has a reference to object B, and object B is being disposed, you may want to clean up that relationship or else you could end up with a leak. The most common place this surfaces is in event handlers (the reference from A->B is one that B controls, because it subscribed to an event on A). In this case, if A is still rooted, B cannot be collected even though it's been disposed.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend unit testing actual ""units of functionality"". Instead of writing a single test for each function, write a test for each scenario or feature. Besides saving you lots of time and allowing you to slip in the tests in under the radar, it is often far more accurate because it literally tests the functions they way they are being used. Too often function by function unit tests don't test the right thing, or even worse, test mocks. </p>

<p>I recommend you avoid using mocks in testing at all costs. The use of a mock essentially invalidates the test because you are testing how it works in idealized circumstances instead of how it works in the real world.</p>

<p>A side benefit is that you also get better dead-code detection. Any code that isn't covered by a high level test probably isn't being used and can be removed. Never underestimate the value of eliminating dead code.</p>

50700,4926,2008-09-08T21:09:29Z,50650,7,"<p>I just <a href=""http://blog.asmartbear.com/2008/09/quality-mortgage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">wrote at length</a> about this very topic.</p>

<p>To summarize my arguments against the common complaints:</p>

<p><strong>Clean-up is invisible to users; we need to add new features.</strong>
The bugs constantly produced by messy code are visible to users too. Time spent fixing those bugs could have been spent adding features. The longer we stay in quality debt, the more time it takes to add each new feature.</p>

<p><strong>We don't have time for clean-up.</strong>
You'd rather spend your time fixing bugs generated by the problem rather than fixing the problem? That's like whacking weeds every weekend instead of pulling them up by the roots. Prevention is sixteen times more valuable than cure.</p>

<p><strong>Developers got themselves into this mess; they should get themselves out of it on their own time.</strong>
Had developers not gotten releases out the door as fast as they did, had they not responded so swiftly to early adopter feedback, even when the product morphed into a beast quite different from its original conception, we wouldn't have our current customers and revenue. We'd be working for another company, not complaining about the software we built.</p>

<p>Attention CEO's: Finger-pointing impedes resolution. Instead, challenge your developers to reduce bug reports. This is easily measured, so you can track time versus results. Remember, developers prefer implementing new features to fixing bugs, so if they're begging for time to fix bugs, it's serious.</p>
"
50709,580,2008-09-08T21:15:28Z,50650,1,"<p>Just do it.  You will be slower in the beginning as you are writing more code and thinking out the problem first.  But you will quickly pass others on the project as you have less errors/bugs and your design is better.</p>

50895,380,2008-09-08T22:51:11Z,50890,2,"<p>It would depend on the geography that you are targeting. For example, in India, you can safely assume it would be a number below 256kbps.</p>

With my current ISP, I typically get 200-300 kB/sec.  Although when the planets align I've gotten as much as 2 MB/sec (the ""quoted"" peak downlink speed).  That was with parallel streams, however.  The peak bandwidth I've achieved on a single stream is 1.2 MB/sec</p>
"
50903,2527,2008-09-08T23:00:30Z,50890,0,"<p>The best strategy is always to give your users options. Why don't you start the stream at a low bitrate that will work for everyone and provide a ""High Quality"" link for those of us with FTTH connections? I believe YouTube has started doing this.</p>
"
50909,2915,2008-09-08T23:04:26Z,50890,2,"<p>Try attacking it from the other angle.  Look at streaming services that cater to the customer you want, and have significant volume (maybe youtube) and see what they're pushing.  You'll find there'a pretty direct correlation between alexa rating (popularity) and quality(minimum bitrate required).  Vimeo will always have fewer users than Youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users.</p>

<p>There are many other factors, and this should only form one small facet of your bandwidth decision, but it's a useful comparison to make.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that you want to degrade gracefully.  As more and more sites come online you'll start bumping into ISPs that limit total transfer, and being able to tell your customers how much of their bandwidth your site is consuming is useful, as well as proclaiming that you are a low bandwidth site.</p>

<p>Further, more and more users are using portable cellular connections (iPhone) where limited bandwidth is a big deal.  AT&amp;T has oversold many markets so being able to get useful video through a tiny link will enable you to capture market that vimeo and Hulu cannot.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, though, the best thing to do is degrade on the fly gracefully.  Measure the bandwidth of the connection continuously and adjust bandwidth as needed for a smooth playback experience with good audio.  Then you can take all users across the gamut...</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allows polymorphic behavior.</li>
<li>Is <em>initially</em> simple and convenient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>May</em> become complex or clumsy over time <em>if</em> more behavior and relations are added.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Second Approach aka Composition</h2>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maps well to non-oop scenarios like relational tables, structured programing, etc</li>
<li>Is straightforward (if not necessarily convenient) to <em>incrementally</em> extend relations and behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
<li>No polymorphism therefore it's less convenient to use related information and behavior</li>
</ul>

In the good old days demos were all about ""what could you technically squeeze out of the machine"". You needed to be a good developer/coder/hacker to achieve the best. Today the development seems to be more like basic technical stuff. Most effects are already provided by the graphics adapter. It's not so much about the code, so as a coder ""you can't show off"". It's more about design, graphics, more design, music and even more design. That's in most cases not the developers' domain :)</p>

<p>actually, the only thing that might be missed is the possibility to have a 'client-server' type of communication inside the web, because java applet could have a stateful connection. on the other hand, you would have to put some server on the other side and open a port for it, which just was too much house-work for shared hosting environments.</p>

<p>Even with the Sun JVM you could have problems.  I've had fun where I've had two 3rd-party Applets requiring different versions of Java which causes all sorts of problems.  Sun have tried to solve this problem by replacing Applets with <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">Java Web Start</a> which gives you a link in the browser that launches the application in it's own window instead of inside the browser.  (In theory with JWS you can have different applications using different VMs but it never seems to work for me as well as it should.)</p>

<p>Advancements with JavaScript have also made it possible to developer much richer web pages so a lot of things in the past that you could only do in Applets can now be done simply with AJAX. </p>

<p>However, remember that Java's big promise has been achieved. We have Flash, Java Applets, Silverlight, and ever-improving JavaScript frameworks.</p>

<p>Now if I made add a personal opinion - I think that Java applets are inelegant. They tend to look ugly, the Java runtime makes its presence in the OS far too known (in terms of runtime visuals, updates, and the ugly installer). Flash is much better with its rich media environment and its transparent (and ubiquitous) deployment.</p>
"
51399,372,2008-09-09T08:39:12Z,51390,34,"<p>I think Java applets were overshadowed by Flash and ActionScript (pun unintended), being much easier to use for what Java Applets were being used at the time (animations + stateful applications). </p>

<p>Flash's success in this respect in turn owes to its much smaller file sizes, as well as benefiting from the Sun vs. Microsoft suit that resulted in Microsoft removing the MSJVM from Internet Explorer, at a time of Netscape's demise and IE's heavy dominance.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on a Java Applet, but in general, I would never an applet unless I had to. But then again, I wouldn't use Flash or Silverlight, either. Applets have a slow load time, and look out of place in webpages. Also, Macromedia/Adobe have outmarketed the good ol' applets.</p>
"
51405,369,2008-09-09T08:44:30Z,51390,8,"<p>I assume it's because java is a ""real"", ie. general purpose language. To make an applet, you have to write code, and there aren't any shortcuts.</p>

<p>Now that flash etc have come along, you can pretty much just drap and drop your way through making a cool animation for your website. This is a much lower barrier for entry - you don't have to know how to program in order to get a flash animation working. So flash proliferates, and java applets are hardly used anymore.</p>
"
51406,2811,2008-09-09T08:45:25Z,51390,7,"<p>I think applets are collateral damage in the battle between Microsoft and Sun.</p>

<p>At first, the JVM was very slow to load and demanded too much memory.
Then, when increase in computing power made the JVM possible, Sun played hard as it attempted to control all things Java:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of another private antitrust lawsuit filed against Microsoft by Sun in March, Sun sought a preliminary injunction requiring Microsoft to include a current Java virtual machine (JVM) in the Windows XP operating system. Microsoft said the decision to include the JVM this week is a direct result of the latest legal entanglement with Sun, but Microsoft plans to disband support for Java in Windows following Jan. 1, 2004. <a href=""http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18828525"">Microsoft Reverses Course, Will Include Java VM In Windows XP--For Now</a></p>

2) Microsoft dropped support for Java in the browser (its propietary MSJVM), and before it did, it would only support the last version it released, which was roughly JDK 1.1 compatible.<br />
3) So today you cannot be sure that an applet will run on the majority of non-developer machines, unlike flash.   </p>

<p>I've heard some objections to this approach, but few of them have been convincing.</p>

<p><strong>It hurts performance</strong> Bah, I say!  Don't optimize without hard data!  Perhaps if you are planning your assemblies to be downloaded over slow links, then minimizing assembly size would be worthwhile.  </p>

<p>Now, your situation is different from mine, so maybe it'll make sense for you, and maybe it won't.  You'll have to figure that out yourself.</p>

<p>Aside: In C#, I once tried putting my unit tests in a class named ""Tests"" that was nested inside the class that it was testing.  This made the correct organization of things obvious.  It also avoided the duplication of names that occurs when tests for the class ""Foo"" are in a class called ""FooTests"".  However, the unit testing frameworks that I had access to refused to accept tests that weren't marked ""public"".  This means that the class that you're testing can't be ""private"".  I can't think of any good reason to require tests to be ""public"", since no one really calls them as public methods - everything is through reflection.  If you ever write a unit testing framework for .Net, please consider allowing non-public tests, for my sake!</p>

<li>With Javascript/HTML/CSS you're going to be heading into cross-browser compatibility hell, especially if you want to support older browsers.  This can be mitigated by the libraries that are available, but it's still a big headache.  With Flash, you write the code once and it just works in all browsers.</li>
<li>Even with the libraries available, Flash user controls are simply more advanced than anything you can find in the world of Javascript/HTML.  In Javascript, you are not going to find anything that comes close to the simplicity and power of a databound user control that Flash provides.</li>

As a matter of fact, this is my preferred way of doing Classic ASP before finally moving to .NET (except in some cases, you will have to mix in VBScript for special cases, i.e. Disconnected Recordset, ExecuteNoRecords, etc.).  It will provide you with better OOP support vs VBScript.  Maybe you can try refactor that to.some sort of Strategy pattern afterward.

<p>We are implementing a process of </p>

<p>1) Business Requirements Statement (BRS)</p>

<p>2) Functional Specification</p>

<p>3) Technical specification</p>

<p>The BRS covers what the business problems are, and what the requirements are around solutions, testing, security, reliability and delivery. This defines what would make a successful solution.</p>

<p>The functional spec details what is needed, how it should look, how long fields should be, etc.</p>

<p>The technical spec details where the data comes from, any tricky code that may need to be considered.</p>

<p>The customer owns the requirements. The developers own the tech specs, and the functional spec is a middle ground. Testing is done against the tech specs (usually unit testing) then against the functional specs (usually system testing) and then against the requirements (UAT).</p>

<p>The important part of this (and we are struggling with) is that the developers still need to deliver to the functional spec, and the original business requirements. In reality the functional and tech specs are just there for clarity.</p>

<p>In short, my main tip is to first work out the process you wish to implement. Then seek agreement from all parties involved in your proposed process, then work on the templates to fit. The templates themselves are only are a small part of the change you want to make.</p>

<p>I'll give two usages examples.  The first is the obvious answer.  The second explains source-indexed pdb's.</p>

<p>1st usage example...</p>

<p>Depending on calling convention and which optimizations the compiler used, it might not be possible for the debugger to manually unwind the stack through a module for which you do not have a pdb.  This can happen with certain third party libraries and even for some parts of the OS.</p>

<p>Consider a scenario in which you encounter an access violation inside of the windows OS.  The stack trace does not unwind into your own application because that OS component uses a special calling convention that confuses the debugger.  If you configure your symbol path to download the public OS pdb's, then there is a good chance that the stack trace will unwind into your application.  That enables you to see exactly what arguments your own code passed into the OS system call.  (and similar example for AV inside of a 3rd party library or even inside of your own code)</p>

<p>2nd usage example...</p>

<p>Pdb's have another very useful property - they can integrate with some source control systems using a feature that microsoft calls ""source indexing"".  A source-indexed pdb contains source control commands that specify how to fetch from source control the exact file versions that were used to build the component.  Microsoft's debuggers understand how to execute the commands to automatically fetch the files during a debug session.  This is a powerful feature that saves the debug egineer from having to manually sync a source tree to the correct label for a given build.  It's especially useful for remote debugging sessions and for analyzing crash dumps post-mortem.</p>

<p>The ""debugging tools for windows"" installation (windbg) contains a document named srcsrv.doc which provides an example demonstrating how to use srctool.exe to determine which source files are source-indexed in a given pdb.</p>

<p>To answer your question ""how do I know"", the ""modules"" feature in the debugger can tell you which modules have a corresponding pdb.  In windbg use the ""lml"" command.  In visual studio select modules from somewhere in the debug menus.  (sorry, I don't have a current version of visual studio handy)</p>

The most important (as your second post points out) is correctness, and to achieve that all you need is to return the Length of the array. Depending on your dataset that might even be ok. If it isn't (say all your arrays are equally long) you can go with something cheap like looking at the first and last value and XORing their values and then add more complexity as you see fit for your data. </p>

<p>A quick way to see how your hashfunction performs on your data is to add all the data to a hashtable and count the number of times the Equals function gets called, if it is too often you have more work to do on the function. If you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable's size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start, otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will trigger reinserts and more Equals evaluations (though possibly more realistic?)</p>

<p>For some objects (not this one) a quick HashCode can be generated by ToString().GetHashCode(), certainly not optimal, but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from ToString() and that is exactly what GetHashcode is looking for</p>

<p>Trivia: The worst performance I have ever seen was when someone by mistake returned a constant from GetHashCode, easy to spot with a debugger though, especially if you do lots of lookups in your hashtable</p>

It is definitely poorer than edit distance, but much, much cheaper. (The official use is for names, and only uses three characters. There's no reason to stop there, though, just use the mapping for every character in the string. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex"">wikipedia</a> for details)</p>

For that reason I'd always build databases with dual FC (4 or 8Gbps fibre links) adapters into dual SAN switches, connected to a dual-controller SAN array. Not only will this scenario be very quick indeed but it will open up the options to utilise the various snapshot techniques that these boxes have to offer. These can enable'live-live' DB replication between sites for DR, instant database restoration and excellent capacity expansion/reduction with no impact on the server/s themselves. Hope this helps, let me know if I can add any more.</p>

55239,4977,2008-09-10T20:26:22Z,55210,0,"<p>Off the top of my head, the solution that makes the most sense would be to pick a letter out of the input string randomly and filter the dictionary based on words that start with that.  Then pick another, filter on the second letter, etc.  In addition, filter out words that can't be made with the remaining text.  Then when you hit the end of a word, insert a space and start it over with the remaining letters.  You might also restrict words based on word type (e.g. you wouldn't have two verbs next to each other, you wouldn't have two articles next to each other, etc).</p>

<p>then from your starting word, you find the set of letters:</p>

<li>As Jason suggested, prepare a dictionary making hashtable with key being word sorted alphabetically, and value word itself (you may have multiple values per key). </li>
<li>Remove whitespace and sort your query before looking it up. </li>

<p>After this, you'd need to do some sort of a recursive, exhaustive search. Pseudo code is very roughly:</p>

  // base case
  if sortedQuery is empty
     solutionList.Add(wordsSoFar)
     return

  // InitialStrings(""abc"") is {""a"",""ab"",""abc""}
  foreach initialStr in InitalStrings(sortedQuery)
    // Remaining letters after initialStr
    sortedQueryRec := sortedQuery.Substring(initialStr.Length)
    words := words matching initialStr in the dictionary
    // Note that sometimes words list will be empty
    foreach word in words
      // Append should return a new list, not change wordSoFar
      wordsSoFarRec := Append(wordSoFar, word) 
      FindWords(solutionList, wordSoFarRec, sortedQueryRec)

<p>In the end, you need to iterate through the solutionList, and print the words in each sublist with spaces between them. You might need to print all orderings for these cases (e.g. ""I am Sam"" and ""Sam I am"" are both solutions).</p>

<p>First off, this only works on Palm OS 5 and is sketchy on some of the early Palm OS 5 devices.  The latest devices are better but not perfect.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to create an alarm for your application using AlmSetAlarm.  This is how you accomplish the ""every X minutes or hours"" part.</p>

<p>When the alarm fires, your application will get a sysAppLaunchCmdAlarmTriggered launch code, even if it's not already running.  If you only want to do something simple and quick, you can do it in response to the launch code and you're done.</p>

<p>After you do your stuff in the alarm launch code, be sure to set up the next alarm so that you continue to be called.</p>

<p>Important notes: You cannot access global variables when responding this launch code!  Depending on the setup in your compiler, you probably also won't be able to access certain C++ features, like virtual functions (which internally use global variables).  There is a setting you can set in Codewarrior that will help with this, but I'm not too familiar with it.  You should architect your code so that it doesn't need globals; for example, you can use FtrSet and FtrGet to store bits of global data that you might need.  Finally, you will only be able to access a single 64KB code segment of 68000 machine code.  Inter-segment jumps don't work properly without globals set up.</p>

<p>You can get around a lot of these restrictions by moving the majority of your code to a PNOlet, but that's an entirely different and more complicated topic.</p>

<p>If you want to do something more complicated that could take a while (e.g. load a web page or download email), it is strongly recommended not to do it during the alarm launch code.  You could do something in the sysAppLaunchCmdDisplayAlarm launch code and display a form to the user allowing them to cancel.  But this is bound to get annoying quickly.</p>

<p>Better for the user experience (but much more complicated) is to become a background application.  This is a bit of black magic and is not really well supported, but it is possible.  There are basically three steps to becoming a background application:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Protect your application database using DmDatabaseProtect.  This will ensure that your application is locked down so it can't be deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Lock your code segment using MemHandleLock and MemHandleSetOwner (set the owner to 0).  This will ensure that your code is loaded into memory and won't be moved.</p></li>
<li><p>Register for some notifications.  For example, the sysNotifyIdleTimeEvent is a great notification to use to do some periodic background processing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you set this up, you can exit from the alarm launch code and then wait for your notifications to fire.  You will then do all of your background processing when your notification handlers are called.</p>

<p>Also make sure that if you allocate any system objects (memory, handles, file handles, etc.), you set their owner to 0 (system) if you expect them to persist after you return from your notification handler.  Otherwise the system will clean them up.  If you do this, be super careful to avoid memory and resource leaks!!  They will never get cleaned up when the owner is set to 0!</p>

<p>To leave background mode, simply do the reverse: unregister for notifications, unlock your code segment, and unprotect your application database.</p>

<p>If you do any network operations in the background, be sure that you set the sockets to non-blocking mode and deal correctly with that!  Otherwise you will block the foreground application and cause problems.</p>

<p>Yes, it is. This, among other things, lets you initialize globally-accessed data structures when it is appropriate, for example inside try/catch blocks. E.g. instead of</p>

<p>At search time:</p>

<p>Consider the input string as a multiset.  Find the first sub-word by traversing the index trie as in a depth-first search.  At each branch you can ask, is letter x in the remainder of my input?  If you have a good multiset representation, this should be a constant time query (basically).</p>

<p>Once you have the first sub-word, you can keep the remainder multiset and treat it as a new input to find the rest of that anagram (if any exists).</p>

<p>Augment this procedure with memoization for faster look-ups on common remainder multisets.</p>

<p>This is pretty fast - each trie traversal is guaranteed to give an actual subword, and each traversal takes linear time in the length of the subword (and subwords are usually pretty darn small, by coding standards).  However, if you <em>really</em> want something even faster, you could include all n-grams in your pre-process, where an n-gram is any string of n words in a row.  Of course, if W = #words, then you'll jump from index size O(W) to O(W^n).  Maybe n = 2 is realistic, depending on the size of your dictionary.</p>

Simply run <code>xbuild</code> just as you would execute <code>msbuild</code> on Microsoft .Net Framework. You don't need Monodevelop installed, xbuild comes with the standard Mono installation.</p>

<p>If your build uses custom tasks, they should still work if they don't depend on Windows executables (such as <code>rmdir</code> or <code>xcopy</code>).</p>

<p>When you are editing project files, use standard Windows path syntax - they will be converted by xbuild, if necessary. One important caveat to this rule is case sensitivity - don't mix different casings of the same file name. If you have a project that does this, you can enable compatibility mode by invoking <code>MONO_IOMAP=case xbuild foo.sln</code> (or try <code>MONO_IOMAP=all</code>).

<p>It's a modification of some group-level access systems that have been <a href=""http://realm3.com/articles/setting_up_user_groups_with_acl_and_auth_in_cakephp_1.2"">documented elsewhere</a>. Our system's aims are to have a simple system where users are authorised on a group-level, but they can have specific additional rights on items that were created by them, or on a per-user basis. We wanted to avoid having to create a specific entry for each user (or, more specifically for each ARO) in the <code>aros_acos</code> table.</p>

<p>We have a Users table, and a Roles table.</p>

<p><strong>Users</strong></p>

<p><code>user_id, user_name, role_id</code></p>

<p><strong>Roles</strong></p>

<p><code>id, role_name</code></p>

<p>Create the ARO tree for each role (we usually have 4 roles - Unauthorised Guest (id 1), Authorised User (id 2), Site Moderator (id 3) and Administrator (id 4)) :</p>

<p><code>cake acl create aro / Role.1</code></p>

<p><code>cake acl create aro 1 Role.2  ... etc ...</code></p>

<p>After this, you have to use SQL or phpMyAdmin or similar to add aliases for all of these, as the cake command line tool doesn't do it. We use 'Role-{id}' and 'User-{id}' for all of ours.</p>

<p>We then create a ROOT ACO - </p>

<p><code>cake acl create aco / 'ROOT'</code></p>

<p>and then create ACOs for all the controllers under this ROOT one:</p>

<p><code>cake acl create aco 'ROOT' 'MyController' ... etc ...</code></p>

<p>So far so normal. We add an additional field in the aros_acos table called <code>_editown</code>  which we can use as an additional action in the ACL component's actionMap.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `aros_acos` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
`aro_id` int(11) default NULL,
`aco_id` int(11) default NULL,
`_create` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_read` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_update` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_delete` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_editown` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
KEY `acl` (`aro_id`,`aco_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
</code></pre>

<p>We can then setup the Auth component to use the 'crud' method, which validates the requested controller/action against an AclComponent::check(). In the app_controller we have something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>private function setupAuth() {
    if(isset($this-&gt;Auth)) {
        ....
        $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = 'crud';
        $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;actionMap = array( 'index'     =&gt; 'read',
                        'add'       =&gt; 'create',
                        'edit'      =&gt; 'update'
                        'editMine'  =&gt; 'editown',
                        'view'      =&gt; 'read'
                        ... etc ...
                        );
        ... etc ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is fairly standard CakePHP stuff. We then have a checkAccess method in the AppController that adds in the group-level stuff to check whether to check a group ARO or a user ARO for access:</p>

<pre><code>private function checkAccess() {
    if(!$user = $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;user()) {
        $role_alias = 'Role-1';
        $user_alias = null;
    } else {
        $role_alias = 'Role-' . $user['User']['role_id'];
        $user_alias = 'User-' . $user['User']['id'];
    }

    // do we have an aro for this user?
    if($user_alias &amp;&amp; ($user_aro = $this-&gt;User-&gt;Aro-&gt;findByAlias($user_alias))) {
        $aro_alias = $user_alias;
    } else {
        $aro_alias = $role_alias;
    }

    if ('editown' == $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;actionMap[$this-&gt;action]) {
        if($this-&gt;Acl-&gt;check($aro_alias, $this-&gt;name, 'editown') and $this-&gt;isMine()) {
            $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow();
        } else {
            $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = 'controller';
            $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('*');
        }
    } else {
        // check this user-level aro for access
        if($this-&gt;Acl-&gt;check($aro_alias, $this-&gt;name, $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;actionMap[$this-&gt;action])) {
            $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;allow();
        } else {
            $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;authorize = 'controller';
            $this-&gt;Auth-&gt;deny('*');
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>setupAuth()</code> and <code>checkAccess()</code> methods are called in the <code>AppController</code>'s <code>beforeFilter(</code>) callback. There's an <code>isMine</code> method in the AppControler too (see below) that just checks that the user_id of the requested item is the same as the currently authenticated user. I've left this out for clarity.</p>

<p>That's really all there is to it. You can then allow / deny particular groups access to specific acos - </p>

<p><code>cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'read'</code></p>

<p><code>cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'editown'</code></p>

<p><code>cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'update'</code></p>

<p><code>cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'delete'</code></p>

<p>I'm sure you get the picture.</p>

<p>Anyway, this answer's way longer than I intended it to be, and it probably makes next to no sense, but I hope it's some help to you ...</p>

<p>-- edit --</p>

<p>As requested, here's an edited (purely for clarity - there's a lot of stuff in our boilerplate code that's meaningless here) <code>isMine()</code> method that we have in our AppController. I've removed a lot of error checking stuff too, but this is the essence of it:</p>

<pre><code>function isMine($model=null, $id=null, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    if(empty($model)) {

        $model = $this-&gt;uses[0];

<blockquote>
  <p>Functions that use pointers or
  references to base classes must be
  able to use objects of derived classes
  without knowing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At its heart LSP is about interfaces and contracts as well as how to decide when to extend a class vs. use another strategy such as composition to achieve your goal.</p>

<p>The most effective way I have seen to illustrate this point was in <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596008673/index.html"">Head First OOA&amp;D</a>. They present a scenario where you are a developer on a project to build a framework for strategy games.</p>

<p>They present a class that represents a board that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://oncodebynotmyself.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/board_thumb.png"" alt=""Class Diagram""></p>

<p>All of the methods take X and Y coordinates as parameters to locate the tile position in the two-dimensional array of <code>Tiles</code>. This will allow a game developer to manage units in the board during the course of the game.</p>

<p>The book goes on to change the requirements to say that the game frame work must also support 3D game boards to accommodate games that have flight. So a <code>ThreeDBoard</code> class is introduced that extends <code>Board</code>.</p>

<p>At first glance this seems like a good decision. <code>Board</code> provides both the <code>Height</code> and <code>Width</code> properties and <code>ThreeDBoard</code> provides the Z axis.</p>

<p>Where it breaks down is when you look at all the other members inherited from <code>Board</code>. The methods for <code>AddUnit</code>, <code>GetTile</code>, <code>GetUnits</code> and so on, all take both X and Y parameters in the <code>Board</code> class but the <code>ThreeDBoard</code> needs a Z parameter as well.</p>

<p>So you must implement those methods again with a Z parameter. The Z parameter has no context to the <code>Board</code> class and the inherited methods from the <code>Board</code> class lose their meaning. A unit of code attempting to use the <code>ThreeDBoard</code> class as its base class <code>Board</code> would be very out of luck.</p>

<p>Maybe we should find another approach. Instead of extending <code>Board</code>, <code>ThreeDBoard</code> should be composed of <code>Board</code> objects. One <code>Board</code> object per unit of the Z axis.</p>

<p>This allows us to use good object oriented principles like encapsulation and reuse and doesnât violate LSP.</p>

  <p>Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first read about LSP, I assumed that this was meant in a very strict sense, essentially equating it to interface implementation and type-safe casting.  Which would mean that LSP is either ensured or not by the language itself.  For example, in this strict sense, ThreeDBoard is certainly substitutable for Board, as far as the compiler is concerned.</p>

<p>After reading up more on the concept though I found that LSP is generally interpreted more broadly than that.</p>

<p>In short, what it means for client code to ""know"" that the object behind the pointer is of a derived type rather than the pointer type is not restricted to type-safety.  Adherence to LSP is also testable through probing the objects actual behavior.  That is, examining the impact of an object's state and method arguments on the results of the method calls, or the types of exceptions thrown from the object.</p>

<p>Going back to the example again, <strong>in theory</strong> the Board methods can be made to work just fine on ThreeDBoard.  In practice however, it will be very difficult to prevent differences in behavior that client may not handle properly, without hobbling the functionality that ThreeDBoard is intended to add.</p>

<p>With this knowledge in hand, evaluating LSP adherence can be a great tool in determining when composition is the more appropriate mechanism for extending existing functionality, rather than inheritance.</p>

 <code>(expr1, expr2)</code> is like <code>{ expr1; expr2; }</code> but you can use the result of <code>expr2</code> in a function call or assignment.</p>

<p>It is often seen in <code>for</code> loops to initialise or maintain multiple variables like this:</p>

<pre><code>for (low = 0, high = MAXSIZE; low &lt; high; low = newlow, high = newhigh)
{
    /* do something with low and high and put new values
       in newlow and newhigh */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from this, I've only used it ""in anger"" in one other case, when wrapping up two operations that should always go together in a macro.  We had code that copied various binary values into a byte buffer for sending on a network, and a pointer maintained where we had got up to:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned char outbuff[BUFFSIZE];
unsigned char *ptr = outbuff;

*ptr++ = first_byte_value;
*ptr++ = second_byte_value;

send_buff(outbuff, (int)(ptr - outbuff));
</code></pre>

<p>Where the values were <code>short</code>s or <code>int</code>s we did this:</p>

<pre><code>*((short *)ptr)++ = short_value;
*((int *)ptr)++ = int_value;
</code></pre>

<p>Later we read that this was not really valid C, because <code>(short *)ptr</code> is no longer an l-value and can't be incremented, although our compiler at the time didn't mind.  To fix this, we split the expression in two:</p>

<pre><code>*(short *)ptr = short_value;
ptr += sizeof(short);
</code></pre>

<p>However, this approach relied on all developers remembering to put both statements in all the time.  We wanted a function where you could pass in the output pointer, the value and and the value's type.  This being C, not C++ with templates, we couldn't have a function take an arbitrary type, so we settled on a macro:</p>

<pre><code>#define ASSIGN_INCR(p, val, type)  ((*((type) *)(p) = (val)), (p) += sizeof(type))
</code></pre>

<p>By using the comma operator we were able to use this in expressions or as statements as we wished:</p>

<pre><code>if (need_to_output_short)
    ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, short_value, short);

latest_pos = ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, int_value, int);

send_buff(outbuff, (int)(ASSIGN_INCR(ptr, last_value, int) - outbuff));
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not suggesting any of these examples are good style!  Indeed, I seem to remember Steve McConnell's <em>Code Complete</em> advising against even using comma operators in a <code>for</code> loop: for readability and maintainability, the loop should be controlled by only one variable, and the expressions in the <code>for</code> line itself should only contain loop-control code, not other extra bits of initialisation or loop maintenance.</p>

<p>I think there are at least two ways around this issue.  It seems you have almost all the javascript you need, you just need to work around AnimationExtender starting the animation on a click.</p>

<p>Option 1: Hide the AnimationExtender button and add a new button of your own that plays the animation.  This should be as simple as setting the AE button's style to ""display: none;"" and having your own button call linkPostback().</p>

<p>Option 2: Re-disable the Animation Extender once the animation has finished with.  This should work, as long as the playAnimation call is blocking, which it probably is:</p>

<pre><code>function linkPostback() {

    var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();
    prm.add_endRequest(playAnimation)

<p>As an aside, it seems your general approach may face issues if there is a delay in receiving the pageRequest.  It may be a bit weird to click a button and several seconds later have the animation happen.  It may be better to either pre-load the data, or to pre-fill the div with some ""Loading..."" thing, make it about the right size, and then populate the actual contents when it arrives.</p>

current display mode (bits per
pixel).</li>
<li>When you need to display something, Lock the backbuffer
surface and store the returned
pointer to the start of surface
memory.</li>
<li>Use pointer arithmetic, calculate the actual pixel position in the
data based on the surface pitch,
bits per pixel and the actual x/y
pixel coordinate.</li>
<li>In my case for simplicity I am sticking to 32bpp, meaning setting a

58450,6042,2008-09-12T07:30:04Z,58280,15,"<p>Ok, Iâve done  a little more research into this now.
When you create a windows service in .Net, you create a class that inherits from System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase (In VB this is hidden in the .Designer.vb file). You then override the OnStart and OnStop function, and OnPause and OnContinue if you choose to. 
These methods are invoked from within the base class so I did a little poking around with reflector.
OnStart is invoked by a method in System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase called ServiceQueuedMainCallback.  The vesion on my machine ""System.ServiceProcess, Version=2.0.0.0"" decompiles like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>
Private Sub ServiceQueuedMainCallback(ByVal state As Object)
    Dim args As String() = DirectCast(state, String())
    Try 
        Me.OnStart(args)
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartSuccessful""))
        Me.status.checkPoint = 0
        Me.status.waitHint = 0
        Me.status.currentState = 4
    Catch exception As Exception
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { exception.ToString }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    Catch obj1 As Object
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { String.Empty }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    End Try
    Me.startCompletedSignal.Set
End Sub
</code>
</pre>

<p>So because Me.OnStart(args) is called from within the Try portion of a Try Catch block I assume that anything that happens within the OnStart method is effectively wrapped by that Try Catch block and therefore any exceptions that occur aren't technically unhandled as they are actually handled in the ServiceQueuedMainCallback Try Catch. So CurrentDomain.UnhandledException never actually happens at least during the startup routine. 
The other 3 entry points (OnStop, OnPause and OnContinue) are all called from the base class in a similar way.</p>

<p>So I âthinkâ that explains why my Exception Handling component canât catch UnhandledException on Start and Stop, but Iâm not sure if it explains why timers that are setup in OnStart canât cause an UnhandledException when they fire. </p>

m_hButton = CreateWindow(TEXT(""BUTTON""), TEXT(""Close""), 
                 WS_VISIBLE | WS_CHILD | BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON,

                 hwnd, NULL, hInst, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>where <strong>50</strong> and <strong>14</strong> are respective DLU dimensions, <strong>4</strong> and <strong>8</strong> are horizontal and vertical dialog template units respectively, based on <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645475%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>GetDialogBaseUnits()</code> function</a> documentation remarks.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<h2>Nothing's perfect</h2>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> as Anders pointed out, those metrics are based on the system font. If your window uses a shell dialog font or simply anything not making your eyes bleed, you're pretty much on your own.</p>

<p>To get your own ""dialog"" base units, you have to retrieve current text metrics with <code>GetTextMetrics()</code> and use character height and average width (<code>tmHeight</code> and <code>tmAveCharWidth</code> of the <code>TEXTMETRIC</code> struct respectively) and translate them with MulDiv by your own, <strong>unless</strong> you are in a dialog, then <code>MapDialogRect()</code> will do all the job for you.</p>

<p>Note that <code>tmAveCharWidth</code> only approximates the actual average character width so it's recommended to use a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd144938.aspx"" rel=""nofollow""><code>GetTextExtentPoint32()</code></a> function on an alphabetic character set instead.</p>

  <p>The zero-initialization (<em>dcl.init</em>) of all local objects with 
  static storage  duration  (<em>basic.stc.static</em>) is performed before
  any other initialization  takes   place. A   local  object of 
  POD type (<em>basic.types</em>)  with static  storage  duration
  initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its
  block is first entered. An implementation  is  permitted to perform
  early initialization of other local objects with static storage
  duration under the same conditions that an implementation is
  permitted to statically initialize an object with static storage
  duration in namespace scope  (<em>basic.start.init</em>). Otherwise  such
  an object is initialized the first time control passes through its
  declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon the
  completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by 
  throwing an exception, the initialization is not complete, so it will
  be  tried again the next time control enters the declaration.  If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being
  initialized, the behavior is undefined.  [<em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>      int foo(int i)
      {
          static int s = foo(2*i);  // recursive call - undefined

  <p>The destructor for a local object with static storage duration will
  be   executed  if  and  only  if  the  variable  was  constructed.

"
59184,1194,2008-09-12T14:54:28Z,59130,22,"<p>A couple of things that I've learned:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Absolutely and brutally minimize the number of images you have that contain text. Doing so will make your life a billion percent easier since you won't have to get a new set of images for every friggin' language.</p></li>
<li><p>Be very wary of css positioning that relies on things always remaining the same size. If  those things contain text, they will <strong>not</strong> remain the same size, and you will then need to go back and fix your designs.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use character types in your sql tables, make sure that any of those that might receive international input are unicode (nchar, nvarchar, ntext). For that matter, I would just standardize on using the unicode versions.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're building SQL queries dynamically, make sure that you include the N prefix before any quoted text if there's any chance that text might be unicode. If you end up putting garbage in a SQL table, check to see if that's there.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that all your web pages definitively state that they are in a unicode format. See Joel's article, mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p>You're going to be using resource files a lot for this project. That's good - ASP.NET 2.0 has great support for such. You'll want to look into the App_LocalResources and App_GlobalResources folder as well as GetLocalResourceObject, GetGlobalResourceObject, and the concept of meta:resourceKey. Chapter 30 of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0470041781"">Professional ASP.NET 2.0</a> has some great content regarding that. The 3.5 version of the book may well have good content there as well, but I don't own it.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about fonts. Many of the standard fonts you might want to use aren't unicode capable. I've always had luck with Arial Unicode MS, MS Gothic, MS Mincho. I'm not sure about how cross-platform these are, though. Also, note that not all fonts support all of the Unicode character definition. Again, test, test, test.</p></li>
<li><p>Start thinking now about how you're going to get translations into this system. Go talk to whoever is your translation vendor about how they want data passed back and forth for translation. Think about the fact that, through your local resource files, you will likely be repeating some commonly used strings through the system. Do you normalize those into global resource files, or do you have some sort of database layer where only one copy of each text used is generated.

59566,751,2008-09-12T17:27:14Z,59390,2,"<p>The short answer to your question is that no, you will probably not run into trouble attempting to do that. Outside the context of a UDF (even still inside a CFC), an un-scoped set statement implies the variables scope.</p>

<p>In addition, in a CFC, the Variables scope is available to all of its functions; it is sort of the global scope within that CFC -- similar to the ""this"" scope, except variables scope is akin to ""private"" variables, whereas the this scope is akin to public variables.</p>

<p>To test this, create test.cfc:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfcomponent&gt;
    &lt;cfset foo = ""bar"" /&gt;
    &lt;cffunction name=""dumpit"" output=""true""&gt;
        &lt;cfdump var=""#variables#"" label=""cfc variables scope""&gt;
        &lt;cfdump var=""#this#"" label=""cfc this scope""&gt;
    &lt;/cffunction&gt;
&lt;/cfcomponent&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and a page to test it, test.cfm:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfset createObject(""component"", ""test"").dumpit() /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And the results will be:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/LSoL6.png""/></p>

<hr>

<p>Now, to address another problem I see in your example code...</p>

<p>In CF, all User Defined Functions have a special un-named scope commonly referred to as the ""var"" scope. If you do the following inside a UDF:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfset foo = ""bar"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you are telling CF to put that variable into the var scope.</p>

<p>To compound things a bit, you can run into problems (variable values changing when you weren't expecting them to) when you are <strong><em>not</em></strong> using the var scope in your inline UDFs.</p>

<p>So the rule of thumb is to always, Always, ALWAYS, <strong><em>ALWAYS</em></strong> var-scope your function-internal variables (including query names). There is a tool called <a href=""http://varscoper.riaforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">varScoper</a> that will assist you in finding variables that need to be var-scoped. Last I checked it wasn't perfect, but it's definitely a start.</p>

<p>However, it is a <em>bad</em> idea to reference (display/use) variables without a scope (obviously excepting var-scoped variables, as you can't specify the scope to read from) in CFCs or even on your standard CFM pages. As of CF7, there were 9 scopes that were checked in a specific order when you read a variable without specifying the scope, first match wins. With CF8, there could be more scopes in that list, I haven't checked. When you do this, you run the risk of getting a value from one scope when you are expecting it from another; which is a nightmare to debug... I assure you. ;)</p>

<p>So in short: <em>implying</em> a variable's scope (on set) is not a terrible idea (though I usually specify it anyway); but <em>inferring</em> variable's scope (on read) is asking for trouble.</p>

  <p>I've been a Sybase ASE, MySQL, and SQL Server DBA on-and off since for almost a decade (along with application development in C, PHP, PL/SQL, C#.NET, and Ruby). So, I have no particular axe to grind in this (sometimes) holy war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The historical performance benefit of stored procs have generally been from the following (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-parsed SQL</li>
<li>Pre-generated query execution plan</li>
<li>Reduced network latency</li>
<li>Potential cache benefits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pre-parsed SQL</strong> -- similar benefits to compiled vs. interpreted code, except on a very micro level. </p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em> 
Not very noticeable at all on the modern CPU, but if you are sending a single SQL statement that is VERY large eleventy-billion times a second, the parsing overhead can add up.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-generated query execution plan</strong>. 
If you have many JOINs the permutations can grow quite unmanageable (modern optimizers have limits and cut-offs for performance reasons). It is not unknown for very complicated SQL to have distinct, measurable (I've seen a complicated query take 10+ seconds just to generate a plan, before we tweaked the DBMS) latencies due to the optimizer trying to figure out the ""near best"" execution plan. Stored procedures will, generally, store this in memory so you can avoid this overhead.</p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em> 
Most DBMS' (the latest editions) will cache the query plans for INDIVIDUAL SQL statements, greatly reducing the performance differential between stored procs and ad hoc SQL. There are some caveats and cases in which this isn't the case, so you'll need to test on your target DBMS.</p>

<p>Also, more and more DBMS allow you to provide optimizer path plans (abstract query plans) to significantly reduce optimization time (for both ad hoc and stored procedure SQL!!).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>WARNING</strong> Cached query plans are not a performance panacea. Occasionally the query plan that is generated is sub-optimal.
  For example, if you send <code>SELECT *
  FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND
  99999999</code>, the DBMS may select a
  full-table scan instead of an index
  scan because you're grabbing every row
  in the table (so sayeth the
  statistics). If this is the cached
  version, then you can get poor
  performance when you later send
  <code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN
  1 AND 2</code>. The reasoning behind this is
  outside the scope of this posting, but

  <p>""In summary, they determined that

  the query plan for that particular

  reused for subsequent executions of
  the same query for the common values
  (âMâ, âRâ, or âTâ), it resulted in
  sub-optimal performance. This
  sub-optimal performance problem
  existed until the query was
  recompiled. At that point, based on
  the @P1 parameter value supplied, the

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Reduced network latency</strong>
A) If you are running the same SQL over and over -- and the SQL adds up to many KB of code -- replacing that with a simple ""exec foobar"" can really add up.
B) Stored procs can be used to move procedural code into the DBMS. This saves shuffling large amounts of data off to the client only to have it send a trickle of info back (or none at all!). Analogous to doing a JOIN in the DBMS vs. in your code (everyone's favorite WTF!)</p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em>
A) Modern 1Gb (and 10Gb and up!) Ethernet really make this negligible. 
B) Depends on how saturated your network is -- why shove several megabytes of data back and forth for no good reason?</p>

<p><strong>Potential cache benefits</strong>
Performing server-side transforms of data can potentially be faster if you have sufficient memory on the DBMS and the data you need is in memory of the server.</p>

<p><em>Still an advantage?</em>
Unless your app has shared memory access to DBMS data, the edge will always be to stored procs.</p>

<p>Of course, no discussion of Stored Procedure optimization would be complete without a discussion of parameterized and ad hoc SQL.</p>

<p><strong>Parameterized / Prepared SQL</strong><br />
Kind of a cross between stored procedures and ad hoc SQL, they are embedded SQL statements in a host language that uses ""parameters"" for query values, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT .. FROM yourtable WHERE foo = ? AND bar = ?
</code></pre>

<p>These provide a more generalized version of a query that modern-day optimizers can use to cache (and re-use) the query execution plan, resulting in much of the performance benefit of stored procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Ad Hoc SQL</strong>
Just open a console window to your DBMS and type in a SQL statement. In the past, these were the ""worst"" performers (on average) since the DBMS had no way of pre-optimizing the queries as in the parameterized/stored proc method.</p>

<p><em>Still a disadvantage?</em>
Not necessarily. Most DBMS have the ability to ""abstract"" ad hoc SQL into parameterized versions -- thus more or less negating the difference between the two. Some do this implicitly or must be enabled with a command setting (SQL server: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx</a> , Oracle: <a href=""http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm"">http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Lessons learned?</strong>
Moore's law continues to march on and DBMS optimizers, with every release, get more sophisticated. Sure, you can place every single silly teeny SQL statement inside a stored proc, but just know that the programmers working on optimizers are very smart and are continually looking for ways to improve performance. Eventually (if it's not here already) ad hoc SQL performance will become indistinguishable (on average!) from stored procedure performance, so any sort of <em>massive</em> stored procedure use ** solely for ""performance reasons""** sure sounds like premature optimization to me.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think if you avoid the edge cases and have fairly vanilla SQL, you won't notice a difference between ad hoc and stored procedures.</p>

<p>The problems with VSS have nothing to do with this example (although the ""Labeling"" feature I believe is implemented inefficiently...)</p>

<p>Here are a few of the issues with VSS </p>

<p>1) Branching is basically impossible
2) Shared checkout is generally not used (I know of a few people who have had success with it)
3) performance is very poor - it is exteremly ""chatty""
4) unless you have a very small repository - it is completely unreliable, to the point for most shops it's a ticking timebomb.</p>

<p>For 4 - the problem is that VSS is implemented by the entire repository being represented as ""flat files"" in the file system.  When the repository gets over a certain size (I believe 4GB but I'm not confident in that figure) you get a chance for ""corruption"".  As the size increases the chances of corruption grow until it becomes an almost certainty.</p>

<p>So take a look at your repository size - and if you are getting into the Gigabytes - I'd strongly recommend you begin planning on replacing VSS.</p>

Anytime you see duplication, eliminate it ASAP.  This may take a little longer initially, but I think the results end up being a lot cleaner, and it helps you rethink your code as you go to ensure you are doing things right.</p>

<p>As for my favorite way of removing duplication.... Closures, especially in my favorite language (Ruby).  They tend to be a really concise way of taking 2 pieces of code and merging the similarities.  Of course (like any ""best practice"" or tip), this can not be blindly done...

<p>I've learnt from experience that making code simple makes it easier for the compiler to optimise it. The larger the method, the harder the compiler has to work!</p>

<p>I've also recently seen a problem where large methods have caused a memory leak. Basically I had a loop very much like the following:</p>

<pre>
while (true)
{
  var smallObject = WaitForSomethingToTurnUp();
  var largeObject = DoSomethingWithSmallObject();
}
</pre>

<p>I was finding that my application was keeping a large amount of data in memory because even though 'largeObject' wasn't in scope until smallObject returned something, the garbage collector could still see it.</p>

<p>I easily solved this by moving the 'DoSomethingWithSmallObject()' and other associated code to another method.</p>

<p>Also, if you make small methods, your reuse within a class will become significantly higher. I generally try to make sure that none of my methods look like any others!</p>

<p><strong>How can one import existing xml into a SQL 2005 database, without relying on the built-in xml type?</strong></p>

<p>A fairly straight forward solution that you already mentioned is the <em>sp_xml_preparedocument</em>, combined with <em>openxml</em>. </p>

<pre><code>declare @XmlDocumentHandle int
declare @XmlDocument nvarchar(1000)
set @XmlDocument = N'&lt;ROOT&gt;
&lt;Customer&gt;
   &lt;FirstName&gt;Will&lt;/FirstName&gt;
   &lt;LastName&gt;Smith&lt;/LastName&gt;
&lt;/Customer&gt;
&lt;/ROOT&gt;'

-- Create temp table to insert data into
create table #Customer 
( 
    FirstName varchar(20),
    LastName varchar(20) 
)
-- Create an internal representation of the XML document.
exec sp_xml_preparedocument @XmlDocumentHandle output, @XmlDocument

-- Insert using openxml allows us to read the structure
insert into #Customer
select 
    FirstName = XmlFirstName,
    LastName = XmlLastName
from openxml ( @XmlDocumentHandle, '/ROOT/Customer',2 )
with 
(
    XmlFirstName  varchar(20) 'FirstName',
    XmlLastName varchar(20) 'LastName'

where ( XmlFirstName = 'Will' and XmlLastName = 'Smith' )

exec sp_xml_removedocument @XmlDocumentHandle

-- Show the data

-- Drop tmp table
drop table #Customer

<p>Reuse is a side-effect of an good design and proper level of abstraction.  Code achieves reuse by doing something useful, but not doing so much as to make it inflexible.  It does not matter whether the code is OO or not - we reuse what works and is not trivial to do ourselves.  That's pragmatism.</p>

<p>The thought of OO as a new way to get to reuse through inheritance is fundamentally flawed.  As you note the LSP violations abound.  Instead, OO is properly thought of as a method of managing the complexity of a problem domain.  The goal is maintainability of a system over time.  The primary tool for achieving this is the separation of public interface from a private implementation.  This allows us to have rules like ""This should only be modified using ..."" enforced by the compiler, rather than code review.</p>

<p>The techniques you use for refactoring should start with the simplest. I would strongly recommand Martin Fowler's book. Combining common code into functions, removing unneeded variables, and other simple techniques gets you a lot of mileage. For list operations, I prefer using functional programming idioms.

However, there are many subtleties in this field, one of which is that locked blocks of code are automatically marked as <strong>critical regions</strong> by the Common Language Runtime.</p>

<p>The effect of code being marked as critical is that, if the entire region cannot be entirely executed, the runtime may consider that your entire Application Domain is potentially jeopardized and, therefore, unload it from memory. To quote <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.thread.begincriticalregion.aspx"">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, consider a task that attempts to allocate memory while holding a lock. If the memory allocation fails, aborting the current task is not sufficient to ensure stability of the AppDomain, because there can be other tasks in the domain waiting for the same lock. If the current task is terminated, other tasks could be deadlocked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, even though your application is single-threaded, this may be a hazard for you. Consider that one method in a locked block throws an exception that is eventually not handled within the block. Even if the exception is dealt as it bubbles up through the call stack, your critical region of code didn't finish normally. And who knows how the CLR will react?</p>

<p>We did this with the rewrite of IONAs Orbix 3.3 product in 2000.</p>

<p>As mentioned by others, using his technique completely decouples the implementation from the interface of the object. Then you won't have to recompile everything that uses Cat if you just want to change the implementation of Purr().</p>

<p>This technique is used in a methodology called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract"">design by contract</a>.</p>

60582,1367,2008-09-13T14:53:59Z,60570,5,"<p>Typically, the only reference to Pimpl class in the header for the Owner class (Cat in this case) would be a forward declaration, as you have done here, because that can greatly reduce the dependencies.</p>

<p>For example, if your Pimpl class has ComplicatedClass as a member (and not just a pointer or reference to it) then you would need to have ComplicatedClass fully defined before it's use. In practice, this means including ""ComplicatedClass.h"" (which will also indirectly include anything ComplicatedClass depends on). This can lead to a single header fill pulling in lots and lots of stuff, which is bad for managing your dependencies (and your compile times).</p>

<p>When you use the pimpl idion, you only need to #include the stuff used in the public interface of your Owner type (which would be Cat here). Which makes things better for people using your library, and means you don't need to worry about people depending on some internal part of your library - either by mistake, or because they want to do something you don't allow so they #define private public before including your files.</p>

<p>If it's a simple class, there's usually no reason to use a Pimpl, but for times when the types are quite big, it can be a big help (especially in avoiding long build times)</p>

 them inline even though you used the
 inline keyword. (Or is it the other
 way around, like what <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60830/what-is-wrong-with-using-inline-functions#60833"">Vaibhav</a>

<p>I think it's usually OK if the

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Here's what the linux <a href=""http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle"">CodingStyle</a> document says about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapter 15: The inline disease</p>
  
  <p>There appears to be a common
  misperception that gcc has a magic
  ""make me faster"" speedup option called
  ""inline"". While the use of inlines can
  be appropriate (for example as a means
  of replacing macros, see Chapter 12),
  it very often is not. Abundant use of
  the inline keyword leads to a much
  bigger kernel, which in turn slows the
  system as a whole down, due to a
  bigger icache footprint for the CPU
  and simply because there is less
  memory available for the pagecache.
  Just think about it; a pagecache miss
  causes a disk seek, which easily takes
  5 miliseconds. There are a LOT of cpu
  cycles that can go into these 5
  miliseconds.</p>
  
  <p>A reasonable rule of thumb is to not
  put inline at functions that have more
  than 3 lines of code in them. An
  exception to this rule are the cases
  where a parameter is known to be a
  compiletime constant, and as a result
  of this constantness you <em>know</em> the
  compiler will be able to optimize most
  of your function away at compile time.
  For a good example of this later case,
  see the kmalloc() inline function.</p>
  
  <p>Often people argue that adding inline
  to functions that are static and used
  only once is always a win since there
  is no space tradeoff. While this is
  technically correct, gcc is capable of
  inlining these automatically without
  help, and the maintenance issue of
  removing the inline when a second user
  appears outweighs the potential value
  of the hint that tells gcc to do
  something it would have done anyway.</p>

<p>The main drawback to inline functions is that it can <strong>increase the size of your executable</strong> (depending on the number of instantiations).  This can be a problem on some platforms (eg. embedded systems), especially if the function itself is recursive.</p>

<p>I'd also recommend making inline'd functions <strong>very small</strong> - The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost.</p>

        {
            Assert(_stack.IsEmpty());
        }

<pre><code>class _2DArray
{
  public:
  int *operator[](const size_t &amp;idx)
  {
    return &amp;ary[idx*800];
  }
  const int *operator[](const size_t &amp;idx) const
  {
    return &amp;ary[idx*800];
  }
};
</code></pre>

"
61690,1849,2008-09-14T22:21:46Z,61680,1,"<p>There's the C like way of doing:</p>

<pre><code>const int xwidth = 800;
const int ywidth = 800;
int* array = (int*) new int[xwidth * ywidth];
// Check array is not NULL here and handle the allocation error if it is
// Then do stuff with the array, such as zero initialize it
for(int x = 0; x &lt; xwidth; ++x)
{
    for(int y = 0; y &lt; ywidth; ++y)
    {
         array[y * xwidth + x] = 0;
    }
}
// Just use array[y * xwidth + x] when you want to access your class.

// When you're done with it, free the memory you allocated with
delete[] array;
</code></pre>

<p>You could encapsulate the <code>y * xwidth + x</code> inside a class with an easy get and set method (possibly with overloading the <code>[]</code> operator if you want to start getting into more advanced C++). I'd recommend getting to this slowly though if you're just starting with C++ and not start creating re-usable fully class templates for n-dimension arrays which will just confuse you when you're starting off.</p>

<p>As soon as you get into graphics work you might find that the overhead of having extra class calls might slow down your code. However don't worry about this until your application isn't fast enough and you can profile it to show where the time is lost, rather than making it more difficult to use at the start with possible unnecessary complexity.</p>

<p>So we'll start with a bit of math. Recall that 800 can be written in powers of 2 as:</p>

<pre><code>800 = 512 + 256 + 32 = 2^5 + 2^8 + 2^9

<p>So we can write our addressing function as:</p>

<pre><code>int index = y &lt;&lt; 9 + y &lt;&lt; 8 + y &lt;&lt; 5 + x;

<p>So if we encapsulate everything into a nice class we get:</p>

<pre><code>class ZBuffer
{
public:
    const int width = 800;
    const int height = 800;

    ZBuffer()
    {
        for(unsigned int i = 0, *pBuff = zbuff; i &lt; width * height; i++, pBuff++)
            *pBuff = 0;
    }

    inline unsigned int getZAt(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)
    {
        return *(zbuff + y &lt;&lt; 9 + y &lt;&lt; 8 + y &lt;&lt; 5 + x);
    }

    inline unsigned int setZAt(unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int z)
    {
        *(zbuff + y &lt;&lt; 9 + y &lt;&lt; 8 + y &lt;&lt; 5 + x) = z;

Almost all server-side languages have some utility method that converts some HTML characters into their entity counterparts.

Recommended.)</p>

<p>Good Tests should be A TRIP (The acronymn isn't sticky enough - I have a printout of the cheatsheet in the book that I had to pull out to make sure I got this right..)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic</strong> : Invoking of tests as well as checking results for PASS/FAIL should be automatic</li>
<li><strong>Thorough</strong>: Coverage; Although bugs tend to cluster around certain regions in the code, ensure that you test all key paths and scenarios.. Use tools if you must to know untested regions</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable</strong>: Tests should produce the same results each time.. every time. Tests should not rely on uncontrollable params.</li>
<li><strong>Independent</strong>: Very important. 
<ul>
<li>Tests should <strong>test only one thing</strong> at a time. Multiple assertions are okay as long as they are all testing one feature/behavior. When a test fails, it should pinpoint the location of the problem.</li>
<li>Tests <strong>should not rely on each other</strong> - Isolated. No assumptions about order of test execution. Ensure 'clean slate' before each test by using setup/teardown appropriately</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Professional</strong>: In the long run you'll have as much test code as production (if not more), therefore follow the same standard of good-design for your test code. Well factored methods-classes with intention-revealing names, No duplication, tests with good names, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Good tests also run <strong>Fast</strong>. any test that takes over half a second to run.. needs to be worked upon. The longer the test suite takes for a run.. the less frequently it will be run. The more changes the dev will try to sneak between runs.. if anything breaks.. it will take longer to figure out which change was the culprit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Update 2010-08:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Readable</strong> : This can be considered part of Professional - however it can't be stressed enough. An acid test would be to find someone who isn't part of your team and asking him/her to figure out the behavior under test within a couple of minutes. Tests need to be maintained just like production code - so make it easy to read even if it takes more effort. Tests should be symmetric (follow a pattern) and concise (test one behavior at a time). Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. the TestDox style). Avoid cluttering the test with ""incidental details"".. become a minimalist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from these, most of the others are guidelines that cut down on low-benefit work: e.g. 'Don't test code that you don't own' (e.g. third-party DLLs). Don't go about testing getters and setters. Keep an eye on cost-to-benefit ratio or defect probability.</p>

<p>At least, that's the way I've seen it done in DB independent libraries' code. You can abstract away the paging logic once you get the data from the engine with the specific query. </p>

<p>If you really are looking for a single, one SQL sentence solution, could you show what you have in mind? Like the SQL for the temp table solution. That would probably get you more relevant suggestions.</p>

<p>I wanted to see what were you thinking because I couldn't see a way to do it with temp tables and not use a engine specific construct. You used specific constructs in the example. I still don't see a way to implement paging in the database with only (implemented) standard SQL. You could bring the whole table in standard SQL and page in the application, but that is obviously stupid.</p>

<p>So the question would now be more like ""Is there a way to implement paging without using LIMIT/OFFSET or equivalent?"" and I guess that the answer is ""Sanely, no."" You could try using cursors but you'll fall prey to database specific sentences/behavior there as well.</p>

<p>A wacko (read stupid) idea that just occurred to me would be to add a page column to the table, say create table test (id int, name varchar, phone varchar, page int) and then you can get page 1 with select * from table where page = 1. But that means having to add code to maintain that column, which, again could only be done by either bringing the whole database or using database specific constructs.

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did I switch? Because i was a bit unhappy with the overall stability of Ankh, since it has some problems actually tracking Solution changes. VisualSVN is âjustâ a TortoiseSVN Frontend, which means it leaves all the âheavy liftingâ to a third-party tool that a) is installed on most Workstations anyway and b) thatâs been tested and used by such a wide audience, itâs really rock-solid.</p>
  
  <p>Now, AnkhSVN is certainly not a bad product, and the people behind it are serious about what they are doing, but having long-deleted files still in my SVN or getting the âPlease Cleanup your solutionâ message getâs annoying after some time, but my biggest gripe is the property window. Itâs nice that there is a nice window with Radio Buttons asking me which property I want to add. Unfortunately, there is no way to manually enter a property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> That was for AnkhSVN 1.x. In the meantime, it was updated to 2.x and <em>much</em> improved. I use it in production on a system where I don't have VisualSVN and it works extremely well now.</p>

There are tools, like GExperts, that will ensure your database components are set to inactive when you save them, and that way you can be sure to set them correctly on the live computer at runtime.</p>

<p>I often wonder if the ""benefits"" are overblown; yes, you can make some of your implementation details even more hidden, and yes, you can change your implementation without changing the header, but it's not obvious that these are big advantages in reality.</p>

<p>That is to say, it's not clear that there's any need for your implementation to be <em>that</em> well hidden, and perhaps it's quite rare that people really do change only the implementation; as soon as you need to add new methods, say, you need to change the header anyway.</p>

<p>[5] A vector's iterators are invalidated when its memory is reallocated. Additionally, inserting or deleting an element in the middle of a vector invalidates all iterators that point to elements following the insertion or deletion point. It follows that you can prevent a vector's iterators from being invalidated if you use reserve() to preallocate as much memory as the vector will ever use, and if all insertions and deletions are at the vector's end. </p>

<p>I think it follows that pop_back only invalidates the iterator pointing at the last element and the end() iterator. We really need to see the data for which the code fails, as well as the manner in which it fails to decide what's going on.  As far as I can tell, the code should work - the usual problem in such code is that removal of element and ++ on iterator happen in the same iteration, the way @mikhaild points out. However, in this code it's not the case: it++ does not happen when pop_back is called.</p>

<p>Something bad may still happen when it is pointing to the last element, and the last element is less than 10. We're now comparing an <em>invalidated</em> it and end(). It may still work, but no guarantees can be made.</p>

<p>With Ext, the HTML is just a single placeholder - UI goes here. From then on, <b>everything</b> is described in JavaScript. DOM interaction is minimized under another (perhaps stronger) API layer.</p>

<p>With the other kits, I find myself starting by doing a bit of HTML design, and then extending the DOM directly with snazzy effects, or just replacing the form input here, an addition there.</p>

<p>The major differences start to happen as I need to deal with event handling, etc. As modules need to ""talk"" to each other, I find myself needing to step away from the DOM, abstracting it away in pieces.</p>

<p>I note that many of these libraries also include some interesting modularization techniques as well. A very clear description is contributed on the Ext website, which includes <a href=""http://extjs.com/learn/Manual:Basic_Application_Design"" rel=""nofollow"">a fancy way to ""protect"" your code with modules</a>. </p>

<p>A new player I haven completely evaluated is <a href=""http://sproutcore.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sproutcore</a>. It seems like Ext in approach, where the DOM is hidden, and you mostly want to deal with the project's API.</p>

<blockquote>
23.2.4.2 A vector satisfies all of the requirements of a container and of a reversible container (given in two tables in 23.1) and of a sequence, including most of the optional sequence requirements (23.1.1).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
23.1.1.12 Table 68

<p>Notice that a.pop_back is equivalent to a.erase(--a.end()).  Looking at vector's specifics on erase:</p>

<blockquote>
23.2.4.3.3 - iterator erase(iterator position) - effects - <strong>Invalidates all the iterators and references after the point of the erase</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, once you call pop_back, any iterators to the previously final element (which now no longer exists) are invalidated.</p>

<p>Looking at your code, the problem is that when you remove the final element and the list becomes empty, you still increment it and walk off the end of the list.</p>

<p>23.1.1, point 12 states that:</p>

<p>Ensure you set the right Content-Type, but also consider setting the Cache options for IE (at least) to <em>allow</em> caching.  If the file is one the user can open rather than save (e.g. an MS Word document) early versions of IE need to cache the file, as they hand off the ""open"" request to the applicable app, pointing to the file that was downloaded in the cache.</p>

<p>There's also a related issue, if the IE6 user's cache is full, it won't properly save the file (thus when the applicable app gets the hand off to open it, it will complain the file is corrupt.</p>

<p>You may also want to turn of any gzip actions on the downloads too (for IE)</p>

<p>IE6/IE7 both have issues with large downloads (e.g. 4.x Gigs...) not a likely scenario since IE doesn't even have a download manager, but something to be aware of.</p>

<p>Finally, IE6 sometimes doesn't nicely handle a download ""push"" if it was initiated from within a nested iframe.  I'm not exactly sure what triggers the issue, but I find it is easier with IE6 to avoid this scenario.</p>

62961,4903,2008-09-15T13:41:24Z,32540,1,"<p>Tristan, you will find that when you try to architecture JavaScript as an MVC application it tends to come up short in one area -- the model. The most difficult area to deal with is the model because the data does not persist throughout the application, and by nature the models seem to change on the client-side pretty consistently. You could standardize how you pass and receive data from the server, but then at that point the model does not really belong to JavaScript -- it belongs to your server-side application.</p>

<p>I did see one attempt awhile back where someone created a framework for modeling data in JavaScript, much like the way SQLite belongs to the application. It was like Model.select( ""Product"" ) and Model.update( ""Product"", ""Some data..."" ). It was basically an object notation that held a bunch of data to manage the state of the current page. However, the minute you refresh, all that data is lost. I'm probably off on the syntax, but you get the point.</p>

<p>If you are using jQuery, then Ben's approach is really the best. Extend the jQuery object with your functions and properties, and then compartmentalize your ""controllers"". I usually do this by putting them into separate source files, and loading them on a section-by-section basis. For instance, if it were an e-commerce site, I might have a JS file full of controllers that handle functionality for the checkout process. This tends to keep things lightweight and easy to manage.</p>

<p>However, in your code example, it can invalidate <strong><code>it</code></strong> when it is pointing to the last element and the value is below 10. In which case Visual Studio debug STL will mark iterator as invalidated, and further check for it not being equal to end() will show an assert.</p>

<p>A table's primary key should be used for identifying uniquely the row, mainly for join purposes. Think a Persons table: names can change, and they're not guaranteed unique.</p>

<p>Think Companies: you're a happy Merkin company doing business with other companies in Merkia. You are clever enough not to use the company name as the primary key, so you use Merkia's government's unique company ID in its entirety of 10 alphanumeric characters. 
Then Merkia changes the company IDs because they thought it would be a good idea. It's ok, you use your db engine's cascaded updates feature, for a change that shouldn't involve you in the first place. Later on, your business expands, and now you work with a company in Freedonia. Freedonian company id are up to 16 characters. You need to enlarge the company id primary key (also the foreign key fields in Orders, Issues, MoneyTransfers etc), adding a Country field in the primary key (also in the foreign keys). Ouch! Civil war in Freedonia, it's split in three countries. The country name of your associate should be changed to the new one; cascaded updates to the rescue. BTW, what's your primary key? (Country, CompanyID) or (CompanyID, Country)? The latter helps joins, the former avoids another index (or perhaps many, should you want your Orders grouped by country too).</p>

  <p>First, what should be the role of testers, designers and non-developers as a whole in the scrum process? If they are equal to other team members a couple of issues arise. Designers and testers usually work on a task after development is done, so they cannot adequately plan for a sprint because of this dependency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If designers and testers can't plan for a sprint because of a development dependency then that means that your development isn't being planned correctly. That's a problem that needs to be fixed.</p>

<p>Your team should be able to say ""Task B requires Task A being done first.  Task A will take 8 hours then Task B will take 4 hours"".  If your task estimates are accurate, then dependencies are not a problem at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, we have deadlines. These are strict and have a lot of impact on prioritization. The end result is backlog changes in the middle of a sprint because of deadline changes, or bad results in the end of the sprint. We also have a lot of non-technical work like customer support that has to be done in the meantime and cannot be planned as it varies a lot.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is happening, then the problem is that you aren't doing Scrum.  The only way that Scrum works is if management buys into the process completely.  This means leaving your developers alone for 30 days while they work on their planned sprint and adding new work through the methods that Scrum has in place to do so.  You add wish list items to the product backlog and then during the sprint planning, developers and stakeholders agree on what will be worked on in the next sprint.</p>

<p>If you consistently have customer support issues interrupting normal development then you should seriously consider dividing the team and have one group dedicated to working on development in Scrum and have another group who takes care of the customer support issues.  You could then rotate people back and forth at the end of each sprint.</p>

63406,NA,2008-09-15T14:28:59Z,63100,7,"<p>In general testers and documenters (and other non-developes)  are all equal members of a scrum team. The idea behind that is to minimize risk. </p>

<p>Requiring a definition of done, which includes a potentially shipable product that's fully tested and documented, forces the project to come together at the end of each sprint.</p>

<p>If testing does not start until AFTER dev. is done, what happens is that a lot of bugs are discovered after the developers are done with a task. So now you have to fix those bugs, and that's very slow and expensive both because bugs interact and because the general rule is: ""The expense of fixing a bug grows exponentially with time.""  Bugs you catch early are cheap and easy to fix, late bugs are a nightmare.</p>

<p>That is why you want testing (and documentation) to move in step with development. And right now you should be asking, how! Testing is slow, how the heck can it move in step with dev? </p>

<p>The answer is automation, that is SCRUM always sits on top of XP or Agile, both demand excellent unit test coverage and TDD. Here's another gotcha to watch out for. The features developers should be the ones writing both, unit and system test. All testing automation should be done by the feature dev. team. Some places split feature dev. from automation dev. and that's bad.</p>

<p>OK, so now you have great automated testing and you run it AT LEAST once a day. And obviously you practice continuous integration right? This reduces the work load of the testers by a huge amount. And that's how testing can stay in step with dev. One more thing, the testers now work on the really hard and creative stuff that's impossible or very difficult to automate, every time they find a bug that way, what ever it took to expose the bug is automated and becomes part of the daily regression tests. Phew, that's a long answer!</p>

<p>Now to the second part of your question. Scrum is about discipline.  Sprints are short and backlog changes during a sprint should NOT happen. Non technical work should be branched of onto a customer support team and they can do Scrum around that. You're right when you say that is sounds like your culture and practices are incompatible with scrum.</p>

<p>In my experience transitioning to Scrum/Agile is a very painful, stressful process and most attempts to transition fail. One of the key's to success is a champion for Scrum/Agile in the executive team. From your description it sounds like you don't have one.  </p>

<p>There are costs and benefits to Scrum, but you're doing it badly you might be incurring costs with little or no benefit.  If you're doing Scrum wrong and badly, you might be better off not doing Scrum at all. </p>

if ( anotherCondition ) parameterString = appendWithDelimiter( parameterString, ""anotherElementName"", "","" );

<pre><code>StringBuilder parameterString = new StringBuilder();
if (condition) parameterString.append(""elementName"").append("","");

<p>The answer is, ""As much as you feel comfortable with"".</p>

64438,8215,2008-09-15T16:28:45Z,55720,3,"<p>There are many variables that can impact your application's performance. I recommend that you do not instantly assume PHP is the problem.</p>

<p>First, how are you serving PHP? Have you tried basic optimization of Apache or IIS itself? Is the server busy processing other kinds of requests? Have you taken advantage of a <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=php+code+accelerator"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP code accelerator</a>? One way to test whether the server is your bottleneck is to try running the application on another server.</p>

<p>Second, is performance of the entire application slow, or does it only seem to affect certain pages? This could give you an indication of where to start analyzing performance. If the entire application is slow, the problem is more likely in the underlying server/platform or with a global SQL query that is part of every request (user authentication, for example). </p>

<p>Third, you mentioned minimizing the number of SQL queries, but what about optimizing the existing queries? If you are using MySQL, are you taking advantage of the various strengths of each storage system? Have you run <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">EXPLAIN</a> on your most important queries to make sure they are properly indexed? This is critical on queries that access big tables; the larger the dataset, the more you will notice the effects of poor indexing. Luckily, there are many articles <a href=""http://www.devshed.com/c/a/MySQL/Analyzing-Queries-for-Speed-with-EXPLAIN/"" rel=""nofollow"">such as this one</a> which explain how to use EXPLAIN.</p>

<p>Fourth, a common mistake is to assume that your database server will automatically use all of the resources available to the system. You should check to make sure you have explicitly allocated sufficient resources to your database application. In MySQL, for example, you'll want to add custom settings (in your my.cnf file) for things like key buffer, temp table size, thread concurrency, innodb buffer pool size, etc.</p>

<p>If you've double-checked all of the above and are still unable to find the bottleneck, a code profiler like Xdebug can definitely help. Personally, I prefer the Zend Studio profiler, but it may not be the best option unless you are already taking advantage of the rest of the Zend Platform stack. However, in my experience it is very rare that PHP itself is the root cause of slow performance. Often, a code profiler can help you determine with more precision which DB queries are to blame.</p>

64763,8597,2008-09-15T17:07:33Z,64420,70,"<p>I found the answer after searching around. Here's what I have done:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a new project in XCode. I think I used the view-based app.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag a WebView object onto your interface and resize.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside of your WebViewController.m (or similarly named file, depending on the name of your view), in the viewDidLoad method:</p>

<pre>NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html""];  
NSData *htmlData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:filePath];  
if (htmlData) {  
  NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; 
  NSString *path = [bundle bundlePath];
  NSString *fullPath = [NSBundle pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html"" inDirectory:path];
  [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:fullPath]]];
}</pre></li>
<li><p>Now any files you have added as resources to the project are available for use in your web app. I've got an index.html file including javascript and css and image files with no problems. The only limitation I've found so far is that I can't create new folders so all the files clutter up the resources folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Trick: make sure you've added the file as a resource in XCode or the file won't be available. I've been adding an empty file in XCode, then dragging my file on top in the finder. That's been working for me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: I realize that Obj-C must not be that hard to learn. But since I already have this app existing in JS and I know it works in Safari this is a much faster dev cycle for me. Some day I'm sure I'll have to break down and learn Obj-C.</p>

Depending on how many standard library functions your runtime has, you may or not be able to use one of those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>AceUnit</h3>
  
  <p>AceUnit (Advanced C and Embedded Unit) bills itself as a comfortable C code unit test framework. It tries to mimick JUnit 4.x and includes reflection-like capabilities. AceUnit can be used in resource constraint environments, e.g. embedded software development, and importantly it runs fine in environments where you cannot include a single standard header file and cannot invoke a single standard C function from the ANSI / ISO C libraries. It also has a Windows port. It does not use forks to trap signals, although the authors have expressed interest in adding such a feature. See the <a href=""http://aceunit.sourceforge.net/"">AceUnit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>GNU Autounit</h3>
  
  <p>Much along the same lines as Check, including forking to run unit tests in a separate address space (in fact, the original author of Check borrowed the idea from GNU Autounit). GNU Autounit uses GLib extensively, which means that linking and such need special options, but this may not be a big problem to you, especially if you are already using GTK or GLib. See the <a href=""http://autounit.tigris.org/"">GNU Autounit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>cUnit</h3>
  
  <p>Also uses GLib, but does not fork to protect the address space of unit tests.</p>
  
  <h3>CUnit</h3>
  
  <p>Standard C, with plans for a Win32 GUI implementation. Does not currently fork or otherwise protect the address space of unit tests. In early development. See the <a href=""http://cunit.sourceforge.net/"">CUnit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>CuTest</h3>
  
  <p>A simple framework with just one .c and one .h file that you drop into your source tree. See the <a href=""http://cutest.sourceforge.net/"">CuTest homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>CppUnit</h3>
  
  <p>The premier unit testing framework for C++; you can also use it to test C code. It is stable, actively developed, and has a GUI interface. The primary reasons not to use CppUnit for C are first that it is quite big, and second you have to write your tests in C++, which means you need a C++ compiler. If these donât sound like concerns, it is definitely worth considering, along with other C++ unit testing frameworks. See the <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page"">CppUnit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>embUnit</h3>
  
  <p>embUnit (Embedded Unit) is another unit test framework for embedded systems. This one appears to be superseded by AceUnit. <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/embunit/"">Embedded Unit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>MinUnit</h3>
  
  <p>A minimal set of macros and thatâs it! The point is to show how easy it is to unit test your code. See the <a href=""http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html"">MinUnit homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>CUnit for Mr. Ando</h3>
  
  <p>A CUnit implementation that is fairly new, and apparently still in early development. See the <a href=""http://park.ruru.ne.jp/ando/work/CUnitForAndo/html/"">CUnit for Mr. Ando homepage</a>.</p>
  
  <p>This list was last updated in March 2008.</p>

<h3>CMocka</h3>

<p>CMocka is a test framework for C with support for mock objects. It's easy to use and setup. <a href=""https://cmocka.org/"">CMocka</a> official homepage.</p>

<h3>Criterion</h3>

<p>Criterion is a cross-platform C unit testing framework supporting automatic test registration, parameterized tests, theories, and that can output to multiple formats, including TAP and JUnit XML. Each test is run in its own process, so signals and crashes can be reported or tested if needed. See the <a href=""https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion"">Criterion homepage</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>HWUT</h3>

<p>HWUT is a general Unit Test tool with great support for C. It can help to create Makefiles, generate massive test cases coded in minimal 'iteration tables', walk along state machines, generate C-stubs and more. The general approach is pretty unique: Verdicts are based on 'good stdout/bad stdout'. The comparison function, though, is flexible. Thus, any type of script may be used for checking. It may be applied to any language that can produce standard output. See <a href=""http://hwut.sourceforge.net/"">HWUT</a> homepage.</p>

They are essentially a list of function pointers. So raising an event doesn't have worse performance implications than iterating through a list of function pointers and calling each one.</p>

<p>At the same time, realize that because of this, events are synchronous. If your event <em>listener</em> is slow, you'll slow down the class <em>raising</em> the events.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;target name=""vss.check""&gt;
    &lt;vssadd localpath=""D:\build\build.00012.zip"" 
        comment=""Added by automatic build""/&gt;

    &lt;attribute name=""file""/&gt;
    &lt;sequential&gt;

            comment=""Added by automatic build""/&gt;
    &lt;/sequential&gt;

Assuming that your web host has ODBC drivers for Jet data (you're not actually using Access, which is the app development part -- you're only using the Jet database engine), the connect string should be sufficient.</p>

The most commonly used module is probably Test::More, which provides all the infrastructure you're likely to need for writing regression tests. The prove utility provides an easy interface for running test suites and summarizing the results. The Test::Differences module (which can be used with Test::More) might be useful to you as well. It formats differences as side-by-side comparisons. As for committing the actual output as the new reference material, that will depend on how your code under test provides output and how you capture it. It should be easy if you write to files and then compare them. If that's the case you might want to use the Text::Diff module within your test suite.</p>

66757,9916,2008-09-15T20:45:00Z,14040,2,"<p>My general stance is that testers should never find unit level bugs (including boundary cases). The bugs testers find should be at the component, integration, or system level. Of course, at first testers may find ""happy path"" bugs and other simple bugs, but these anomalies should be used to help developers improve.</p>

<p>Part of your problem could be using $100 dollar per hour developers and $30 per hour testers :}. But regardless of the cost, I think knowing that bugs found earlier in the development cycle are inevitably cheaper, you'd probably still save money by having the developers own more testing. If you have a highly paid dev team and hack testers, you will probably find a lot of the big obvious issues, but you'll miss a lot of the more obscure bugs that will come back to haunt you later.</p>

<p>So, I suppose the answer to your question is that testers should test as much as you want them to. You can fire all of your testers and have the developers do all of the testing, or you can hire an army of testers and let the developers check in whatever they want.</p>

<li><p>Further to #2, before you write the output to file, scan it for local urls and then add those to your list of files to download. While you're there, change those urls to link to what you'll eventually name your output so you have a functioning web at the end.

function rand_sort($a, $b) {

    [2, 1, 3] =&gt; 24615

67160,9249,2008-09-15T21:27:39Z,24270,4,"<p>I believe the most beneficial quality of OOP is data hiding/managing. However, there are a LOT of examples where OOP is misused and I think this is where the confusion comes in. </p>

<p>Just because you can make something into an object does not mean you should. However, if doing so will make your code more organized/easier to read then you definitely should.</p>

<p>A great practical example where OOP is very helpful is with a ""product"" class and objects that I use on our website. Since every page is a product, and every product has references to other products, it can get very confusing as to which product the data you have refers to. Is this ""strURL"" variable the link to the current page, or to the home page, or to the statistics page? Sure you could make all kinds of different variable that refer to the same information, but proCurrentPage->strURL, is much easier to understand (for a developer).</p>

<p>In addition, attaching functions to those pages is much cleaner. I can do proCurrentPage->CleanCache(); Followed by proDisplayItem->RenderPromo(); If I just called those functions and had it assume the current data was available, who knows what kind of evil would occur. Also, if I had to pass the correct variables into those functions, I am back to the problem of having all kinds of variables for the different products laying around.</p>

<p>Instead, using objects, all my product data and functions are nice and clean and easy to understand.</p>

<p>However. The big problem with OOP is when somebody believes that EVERYTHING should be OOP. This creates a lot of problems. I have 88 tables in my database. I only have about 6 classes, and maybe I should have about 10. I definitely don't need 88 classes. Most of the time directly accessing those tables is perfectly understandable in the circumstances I use it, and OOP would actually make it more difficult/tedious to get to the core functionality of what is occurring.</p>

<p>I believe a hybrid model of objects where useful and procedural where practical is the most effective method of coding. It's a shame we have all these religious wars where people advocate using one method at the expense of the others. They are both good, and they both have their place. Most of the time, there are uses for both methods in every larger project (In some smaller projects, a single object, or a few procedures may be all that you need).</p>

IOutputChannel channel = factory.CreateChannel();
...
channel.SendMessage(myRawMessage);
</code></pre>

<p>If you needed to send to a two-way service, just use IRequestChannel instead.</p>

<p>If you're doing routing, it is, in general, a lot easier to just deal with generic channel shapes (with a generic catch-all service contract to the outside) and just make sure the message you're sending has all the right headers and properties.</p>

<p>As far as what measurement is practical, well, what are you worried about?  All of the descriptions that you list have value.  Database size matters primarily for scaling, in my opinion (you can write a very simple app if you have a very simple schema, even if there are hundreds of thousands of rows in the database).  The feature list will probably determine the number and complexity of UI pages, which will in turn help to dictate the code length.</p>

For sufficiently large projects you may, in fact, be better off developing your own framework, to meet your own needs.  I have seen many times where people were held back in the decisions they could make, or the work they could produce, because they were trying to do something that the framework didn't anticipate.  And doing these things that the framework doesn't anticipate can be very troublesome.  The nice thing about making your own framework, is that it can evolve with your project, to be a help to you system, instead of a hindrance.</p>

<p>Python makes this very easy: <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html"">timeit</a> is your friend.</p>

69252,10703,2008-09-16T03:51:20Z,69250,25,"<p>Without any optimization on, the flow through your code is linear.  If you are on line 5 and single step, you step to line 6.  With optimization on, you can get instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and all sorts of optimizations.<br>
For example:</p>

<pre><code>
void foo() {
1:  int i;
2:  for(i = 0; i &lt 2; )
3:    i++;
4:  return;
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, without optimization, you could single step through the code and hit lines 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4</p>

<p>With optimization on, you might get an execution path that looks like: 2, 3, 3, 4 or even just 4! (The function does nothing after all...)</p>

<p>Bottom line, debugging code with optimization enabled can be a royal pain! Especially if you have large functions.</p>

<p>Note that turning on optimization changes the code! In certain environment (safety critical systems), this is unacceptable and the code being debugged has to be the code shipped. Gotta debug with optimization on in that case.</p>

<p>While the optimized and non-optimized code should be ""functionally"" equivalent, under certain circumstances, the behavior will change.<br>
Here is a simplistic example:<br>
<code><pre>
    int* ptr = 0xdeadbeef;  // some address to memory-mapped I/O device
    *ptr = 0;   // setup hardware device
    while(*ptr == 1) {    // loop until hardware device is done
       // do something
    }
</pre></code></p>

<p>With optimization off, this is straightforward, and you kinda know what to expect.
However, if you turn optimization on, a couple of things might happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>The compiler might optimize the while block away (we init to 0, it'll never be 1)</li>
<li>Instead of accessing memory, pointer access might be moved to a register->No I/O Update</li>
<li>memory access might be cached (not necessarily compiler optimization related)</li>
</ul>

<p>In all these cases, the behavior would be drastically different and most likely wrong.</p>

69313,3631,2008-09-16T04:07:18Z,69250,4,"<p>Another crucial difference between debug and release is how local variables are stored.  Conceptually local variables are allocated storage in a functions stack frame.  The symbol file generated by the compiler tells the debugger the offset of the variable in the stack frame, so the debugger can show it to you.  The debugger peeks at the memory location to do this.</p>

<p>However, this means every time a local variable is changed the generated code for that source line has to write the value back to the correct location on the stack.  This is very inefficient due to the memory overhead.</p>

<p>In a release build the compiler may assign a local variable to a register for a portion of a function.  In some cases it may not assign stack storage for it at all (the more registers a machine has the easier this is to do).</p>

<p>However, the debugger doesn't know how registers map to local variables for a particular point in the code (I'm not aware of any symbol format that includes this information), so it can't show it to you accurately as it doesn't know where to go looking for it.</p>

<p>Another optimization would be function inlining.  In optimized builds the compiler may replace a call to foo() with the actual code for foo everywhere it is used because the function is small enough.  However, when you try to set a breakpoint on foo() the debugger wants to know the address of the instructions for foo(), and there is no longer a simple answer to this -- there may be thousands of copies of the foo() code bytes spread over your program.  A debug build will guarantee that there is somewhere for you to put the breakpoint.</p>

<p>Most optimizations mess with the order of machine codes.  Loop unrolling is a good example.  Common subexpressions can be lifted out of loops.  With optimization turned on, even the simplest level, you may be trying to set a breakpoint on a line that, at the machine code level, doesn't exist.   Sometime you can't monitor a local variable due to it being kept in a CPU register, or perhaps even optimized out of existence!</p>

Sadly the element and property names don't directly match those in the script suite, but you can look at the dictionary for System Events or usually guess the right terminology.</p>

<p>Using this you can determine two things.  First, the <code>focused</code> property isn't on the <code>menu item</code>, but rather there is a <code>text field</code> within the <code>menu item</code> that is focused.  Second, the menu item has a <code>selected</code> property.</p>

<p>With this, I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>tell application ""System Events""
    tell (first process whose frontmost is true)
    	set helpMenuItem to menu bar item ""Help"" of menu bar 1

    	-- Use reference form to avoid building intermediate object specifiers, which Accessibility apparently isn't good at resolving after the fact.
    	set searchBox to a reference to menu item 1 of menu of helpMenuItem
    	set searchField to a reference to text field 1 of searchBox

<li><p>Go to the [getting started page][1] but don't download everything you see. Focus on just the big green numbers 1 and 2, that is the links to download Visual Studio 2000, the tools for Beta 2 VS 200, and the Beta 1 pack as well as the Blend 2.5 June 2008 preview. </p></li>
<li><p>Click on Learn on the menu (or click [here][2] ) and watch on lien or download the first video, the Silverlight install experience. </p></li>
<li><p>Assuming you haven't worked in Silverlight or WPF before, I'd take a look at our [showcase][3] applications, just to get a sense of what can be done with Silverlight. </p></li>
<li><p>Once you've done that, the order of videos Iâve recommended in the past is in [this blog entry.][4] (which you'll see is where i cribbed these notes from)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once the basics are under your belt, be sure to check out our expanding collection of [tutorials][5], [videos][6], [webcasts][7], and we have a lot more on the way, including forthcoming books, and a number of alternatives. Also, tomorrow I start a monthly blog cast with [Sparkling Client][8] which I hope will be fun and informative.</p>

<p>Finally, when you have questions, you certainly can ask here (this looks like a tremendous resource!) but if they are Silverlight related you may also want to post them on our [forums][9] </p>

This process can remove intermediate results which are unncessary to complete an expression or function evaluation, but may be of interest to you when debugging.  Similarly, optimizations can alter the apparent control flow so that things may happen in a slightly different order than what appears in the source code.  This is done to skip unnecessary or redundant calculations.  This rejiggering of code can mess with the mapping between source code line numbers and object code addresses making it hard for a debugger to follow the flow of control as you wrote it.</p>

<p>Debugging in unoptimized mode allows you to see everything you've written as you've written it without the optimizer removing or reordering things.</p>

<p>Once you are happy that your program is working correctly you can turn on optimizations to get improved performance.  Even though optimizers are pretty trustworthy these days, it's still a good idea to build a good quality test suite to ensure that your program runs identically (from a functional point of view, not considering performance) in both optimized and unoptimized mode.</p>

<p>Essentially encrypting your emails in the database 'just in case' is not really making the database more secure. Where are the keys stored for the database? What file permissions are used for these keys? Is the database accesable publically? Why? What kind of account restrictions are in place for these accounts? Where is the machine stored, who has physical access to this box? What about remote login/ssh access etc. etc. etc.</p>

<p>So I guess you can encrypt the emails if you want, but if that is the extent of the security of the system then it really isn't doing much, and would actually make the job of maintaining the database harder.</p>

If said system is the components of a single application, then there are various techniques such as those involving MVC (Model View Controller) and interfaces for IoC / Dependency Injection that facilitate decoupling of components.</p>

<p>From the perspective of physically isolated software architectures, CORBA and COM support local or networked interop and use a ""common tongue"" of things like ATL. These have been deprecated by XML services such as SOAP, which uses WSDL for performing coupling. There's nothing that stops a SOAP client from using a WSDL for run-time late coupling, although I rarely see it. Then there are things like JSON, which is like XML but optimized, and Google Protocol Buffers which optimizes the interop but is typically precompiled and not late-coupled.</p>

<p>When it comes to IPC (interprocess communications), two systems need only to speak a common ""protocol"". This could be XML, it could be a shared class library, or it could be something proprietary. Even at the proprietary level, you're still ""coupled"" by memory streams, TCP/IP networking, shared file (memory or hard disk), or some other mechanism, and you're still using bytes, and ultimately 1's and 0's.</p>

70572,11436,2008-09-16T09:07:31Z,47400,17,"<p>I appreciated knox's and david's answers. My answer will be somewhere between theirs: just make <strong><em>forms that do not need to be debugged</em></strong>!</p>

<p>I think that forms should be exclusively used as what they are basically, meaning graphic interface <strong><em>only</em></strong>, meaning here that they do not have to be debugged! The debugging job is then limited to your VBA modules and objects, which is a lot easier to handle. </p>

<p>There is of course a natural tendency to add VBA code to forms and/or controls, specially when Access offers you these great ""after Update"" and ""on change"" events, but I definitely advise you <strong>not</strong> to put any form or control specific code in the form's module. This makes further maintenance and upgrade very costy, where your code is split between VBA modules and forms/controls modules.</p>

<p>This does not mean you cannot use anymore this <code>AfterUpdate</code> event! Just put standard code in the event, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub myControl_AfterUpdate()  
    CTLAfterUpdate myControl
    On Error Resume Next
    Eval (""CTLAfterUpdate_MyForm()"")
    On Error GoTo 0  
End sub
</code></pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>CTLAfterUpdate</code> is a standard procedure run each time a control is updated in a form</p></li>
<li><p><code>CTLAfterUpdateMyForm</code> is a specific procedure run each time a control is updated on MyForm</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have then 2 modules. The first one is </p>

<ul>
<li><code>utilityFormEvents</code><br>
 where I will have my CTLAfterUpdate generic event</li>
</ul>

<p>The second one is </p>

<ul>
<li><code>MyAppFormEvents</code><br>
 containing the specific code of all specific forms of the MyApp application
 and including the CTLAfterUpdateMyForm procedure. Of course, CTLAfterUpdateMyForm
 might not exist if there are no specific code to run. This is why we turn the 
 ""On error"" to ""resume next"" ...</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing such a generic solution means a lot. It means you are reaching a high level of code normalization (meaning painless maintenance of code). And when you say that you do not have any form-specific code,  it also means that form modules are fully standardized, and their production can be <strong><em>automated</em></strong>: just say which events you want to manage at the form/control level, and define your generic/specific procedures terminology.<br>
Write your automation code, once for all.<br>
It takes a few  days of work but it give exciting results. I have been using this solution for the last 2 years and it is clearly the right one: my forms are fully and automatically created from scratch with a ""Forms Table"", linked to a ""Controls Table"".<br>
I can then spend my time working on the specific procedures of the form, if any.</p>

<p>Code normalization, even with MS Access, is a long process. But it is really worth the pain!</p>

<p>You're left with words and word counts. Do this for a while and you get a comprehensive set of words that appear in your documents. You can then create an index for these words:
""aardvark"" is 1, ""apple"" is 2, ..., ""z-index"" is 70092. </p>

<p>Now you can take your word bags and turn them into vectors. For example, if your document contains two references for aardvarks and nothing else, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[2 0 0 ... 70k zeroes ... 0].

<p>After this you can count the ""angle"" between the two vectors with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product"">a dot product</a>. The smaller the angle, the closer the documents are.</p>

<p>There are a lot of questionable ways of freeing memory, for example you can use <code>delete</code> on your <code>char</code> array (rather than <code>delete[]</code>) and it will likely work fine. I <a href=""http://www.byteclub.net/blog/zooba/?p=77"" rel=""nofollow"">blogged</a> in detail about this (apologies for the self-link, but it's easier than rewriting it all).</p>

<p>The compiler is not so much the issue as the platform. Most libraries will use the allocation methods of the underlying operating system, which means the same code could behave differently on Mac vs. Windows vs. Linux. I have seen examples of this and every single one was questionable code.</p>

<p>The safest approach is to always allocate and free memory using the same data type. If you are allocating <code>char</code>s and returning them to other code, you may be better off providing specific allocate/deallocate methods:</p>

<pre><code>SOME_STRUCT* Allocate()
{
    size_t cb; // Initialised to something
    return (SOME_STRUCT*)(new char[cb]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>void Free(SOME_STRUCT* obj)
{
    delete[] (char*)obj;
}

<p>(Overloading the <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> operators may also be an option, but I have never liked doing this.)</p>

71802,9631,2008-09-16T12:44:27Z,71720,1,"<p>The answer I discovered eventually was that while OpenGL only has its one amalgamated <code>MODELVIEW</code> matrix, in D3D the ""world"" and ""view"" transforms are kept separate, and placing lights seems to be the major reason for this.  So the answer is you use <code>D3DTS_VIEW</code> to set up matrices that should apply to your lights, and <code>D3DTS_WORLD</code> to set up matrices that apply to the placement of your geometry in the world.</p>

<p>So actually the D3D system kinda makes more sense than the OpenGL way.  It allows you to specify your light positions whenever and wherever the heck you feel like it once and for all, without having to constantly reposition them so that they get transformed by your  current ""view"" transform.  OpenGL has to work that way because it simply doesn't know what you think your ""view"" is vs your ""model"".  It's all just a modelview to GL.</p>

<p>(Comment - apologies if I'm not supposed to answer my own questions here, but this was a real question that I had a few weeks ago and thought it was worth posting here to help others making the shift from OpenGL to D3D.  Basic overviews of the D3D lighting and rendering pipeline seem hard to come by.)</p>

<p>There are a few ways you can also pay some attention to n-grams, strings of two or more words kept in order.

Mathematically, the main idea is to ask, probabilistically, if these words appear next to each other more often than you would guess by their frequencies alone.  If you see a phrase with a high mutual information score in your search query (or while indexing), you can get better results by trying to keep these words in sequence.</p>

<p>The Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as ""pass-by-reference"" in Java.</p>

<p>The key to understanding this is that something like</p>

<pre><code>Dog myDog;
</code></pre>

<p>is <em>not</em> a Dog; it's actually a <em>pointer</em> to a Dog.</p>

<p>What that means, is when you have</p>

<pre><code>Dog myDog = new Dog(""Rover"");
foo(myDog);
</code></pre>

<p>you're essentially passing the <em>address</em> of the created <code>Dog</code> object to the <code>foo</code> method.</p>

<p>(I say essentially because Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)</p>

<p>Suppose the <code>Dog</code> object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.</p>

<p>if the Method were defined as</p>

<pre><code>public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName(""Max"");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog(""Fifi"");  // BBB
    someDog.setName(""Rowlf"");   // CCC
}
</code></pre>

<p>let's look at what's happening.</p>

<ul>
<li>the parameter <code>someDog</code> is set to the value 42</li>
<li>at line ""AAA""

<ul>
<li><code>someDog</code> is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 42)</li>
<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max</li>
</ul></li>
<li>at line ""BBB""

<ul>
<li>a new <code>Dog</code> is created. Let's say he's at address 74</li>
<li>we assign the parameter <code>someDog</code> to 74 </li>
</ul></li>
<li>at line ""CCC""

<ul>
<li>someDog is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 74)</li>
<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf</li>
</ul></li>
<li>then, we return</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's think about what happens outside the method:</p>

<p><em>Did <code>myDog</code> change?</em></p>

<p>There's the key.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that <code>myDog</code> is a <em>pointer</em>, and not an actual <code>Dog</code>, the answer is NO. <code>myDog</code> still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original <code>Dog</code> (but note that because of line ""AAA"", its name is now ""Max"" - still the same Dog; <code>myDog</code>'s value has not changed.)</p>

<p>It's perfectly valid to <em>follow</em> an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.</p>

<p>Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.</p>

<p>In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.</p>

<p>If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the <code>foo</code> method we defined above would have changed where <code>myDog</code> was pointing when it assigned <code>someDog</code> on line BBB.</p>

<p>Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.</p>

<p>For static text, I would use RESX files.  For me, as .Net programmer, they are easy to use and the .Net Framework has good support for them.    </p>

<p>For any dynamic text, I tend to store such information in the database, especially if the site maintainer is going to be a non-developer.

<p>Article Id | Language Id | Language Specific Article Text | Created By | Created Date</p>

<p>Second Table: Article Id | Language Id | Language Specific Article Text</p>

73928,2230,2008-09-16T15:59:55Z,71980,7,"<p>First, you might not actually have to do anything at all, if all you need to do is read the contents. A BSTR type is a pointer to a null-terminated wchar_t array already. In fact, if you check the headers, you will find that BSTR is essentially defined as:</p>

<pre><code>typedef BSTR wchar_t*;
</code></pre>

<p>So, the compiler can't distinguish between them, even though they have different semantics.</p>

<p>There is are two important caveat.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><s>BSTRs are supposed to be immutable. You should never change the contents of a BSTR after it has been initialized. If you ""change it"", you have to create a new one assign the new pointer and release the old one (if you own it).</s><br />
<i>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: this is not true; sorry! You can modify BSTRs in place; I very rarely have had the need.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>BSTRs are allowed to contain embedded null characters, whereas traditional C/C++ strings are not.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a fair amount of control of the source of the BSTR, and can guarantee that the BSTR does not have embedded NULLs, you can read from the BSTR as if it was a wchar_t and use conventional string methods (wcscpy, etc) to access it. If not, your life gets harder. You will have to always manipulate your data as either more BSTRs, or as a dynamically-allocated array of wchar_t. Most string-related functions will not work correctly.</p>

<p>Let's assume you control your data, or don't worry about NULLs. Let's assume also that you really need to make a copy and can't just read the existing BSTR directly. In that case, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>UINT length = SysStringLen(myBstr);        // Ask COM for the size of the BSTR
wchar_t *myString = new wchar_t[lenght+1]; // Note: SysStringLen doesn't 
                                           // include the space needed for the NULL

wcscpy(myString, myBstr);                  // Or your favorite safer string function

// ...

delete myString; // Done
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using class wrappers for your BSTR, the wrapper should have a way to call SysStringLen() for you. For example:</p>

<pre><code>CComBString    use .Length();
_bstr_t        use .length();
</code></pre>

"
74003,145,2008-09-16T16:06:21Z,73930,5,"<p>You use a .desktop file for icons under linux.  Where to put the icon depends on what distribution and what desktop environment you are using.  Since I'm currently running Gnome on Fedora 9, I will answer it in those terms.</p>

<p>An example foo.desktop file would be:</p>

<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
GenericName=Generic Piece Of Software
Name=FooBar
Exec=/usr/bin/foo.sh
Icon=foo.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Qt;Gnome;Applications;
</code></pre>

<p>The .desktop file should under Fedora 9 Gnome be located in /usr/share/applications/ , you can run a locate on .desktop to figure out where you should put in on your distro.  Gnome will generally look in the KDE icon directory to see if there are other icons there also....</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Encoding, Name and Exec should speak for themselves.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Generic name == Brief Description of application.</li>
  <li>Icon == The image to display for the icon</li>
  <li>Terminal == Is this a terminal application, should I start it as one?</li>
  <li>Type == Type of program this is, can be used in placing the icon in a menu.</li>
  <li>Categories == This information is what is mainly used to place the icon in a given menu if an XML file to specify such is not present.  The setup for menus is handled a little differently by everyone.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more attributes you can set, but they aren't strictly necessary.</p>

<p>The image file used sits somewhere in the bowels of the /usr/share/icons/ directory.  You can parse through that to find all the wonders of how such things work, but the basics are that you pick the directory for the icon type (in my case gnome) and place the image within the appropriate directory (there is a scalable directory for .svg images, and specific sizes such as 48x48 for raster images.  Under Gnome all images are generally .png).</p>

<p>You can also do this without the YUI library and Hack control. All you really need to do is put an onmouseover=""this.style.width='auto'"" onmouseout=""this.style.width='100px'"" (or whatever you want) on the select element. The YUI control gives it that nice animation but it's not necessary. This task can also be accomplished with jquery and other libraries (although, I haven't found explicit documentation for this)</p>

<p>-- amendment to the edit:<br>
IE has a problem with the onmouseout for select controls (it doesn't consider mouseover on options being a mouseover on the select). This makes using a mouseout very tricky. The first solution is the best I've found so far.</p>

In those cases the crash handler of the JVM kicks in and dumps the state. It could also generate a OS core file (Dr. Watson on Windows and core dump on *nix).</p>

<p>On Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process.

<p>In fact, the 'xterm' program or whatever derivative you use on your UNIX box is properly referred to as a <strong>terminal emulator</strong> - it behaves (from both your point of view and that of the operating system) much like one of those old-fashioned terminal machines.</p>

<p>This makes it slightly complicated to handle input in interesting ways, since there are lots of different kinds of terminals, and your UNIX system has to know about the capabilities of each kind. These capabilities were traditionally stored in a <strong>termcap</strong> file, and I think more modern systems use <strong>terminfo</strong> instead. Try</p>

<pre><code>man 5 terminfo
</code></pre>

<p>on a Linux system for more information.</p>

<p>Now, the good news is that you don't need to do too much messing about with terminal capabilities, etc. to have a commandline application that does interesting things with input or windowing features. There's a library, <strong>curses</strong>, that will help. Lookup </p>

    createOMNamespace(""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"", ""xsi"");

env.declareNamespace(xsi);

<h3>Hand-coded</h3>

<p>If you are ""hand-coding"" the service you might do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SOAPFactory fac = OMAbstractFactory.getSOAP11Factory();   
SOAPEnvelope envelope = fac.getDefaultEnvelope();
OMNamespace xsi = fac.createOMNamespace(""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"", ""xsi"");

<p>It's ideal for embedded systems as it's very lightweight and simple.  I had no problems getting it to work on the target platform as well as on the desktop.  In addition to writing the unit tests, all that's required is:</p>

<ul>
<li>a header file included wherever
you're calling the CuTest routines</li>
<li>a single additional 'C' file to be
compiled/linked into the image</li>
<li>some simple code added to to main to
set up and call the unit tests - I
just have this in a special main()
function that gets compiled if
UNITTEST is defined during the
build.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system needs to support a heap and some stdio functionality (which not all embedded systems have). But the code is simple enough that you could probably work in alternatives to those requirements if your platform doesn't have them.</p>

<p>With some judicious use of extern ""C""{} blocks it also supports testing C++ just fine.</p>

<p>2) It looks like Java 7 is going to be adding extension methods to java - which allows you just to attach a specific method on to a class:  so you could write that join method and add it as an extension method to List or even to Collection.</p>

<p>Solution 1 is probably the only realistic one, now, though since Java 7 isn't out yet :) But it should work just fine.</p>

<p>I credit this book with teaching me more about software development than any programming book I ever read.</p>

<p>The central thread in the book is how our romantic (artistic) and classical (technical/rational) perceptions of the world are both derived from how we perceive quality in the environment around us. This understanding is then applied to apparently mundane tasks like motorcycle maintenance.</p>

<p>To give some examples of how this applies to coding:</p>

<ul>
<li>The section on how to approach the motorcycle with a 'quality mindset' that leads to progress is just as applicable to reaching 'the zone' in programming.</li>
<li>The section on 'gumption traps' that prevent progress and lead to you damaging the machine is priceless. The solutions that are presented work just as well when trying to modify legacy code without introducing bugs.</li>
<li>The section on how a purely classical description of an engine part is useless (because it lacks any place for the user to stand) should be read by anyone involved in requirements analysis.</li>

Do you work for a company that starts with ""I"", that has a website that starts with ""BC""? That sounds exactly like what I did when I first started developing in .net (and was young and stupid) -- I crammed everything I could think of in session and application. Needless to say, that was double-plus ungood.<br />
In general, eschew session as much as possible. Certainly, non-serializable objects shouldn't be stored there (database connections and such), but even big, serializable objects shouldn't be either. You just don't want the overhead.</p>

78055,30018,2008-09-16T22:41:58Z,77960,1,"<p>Ideally, the session in ASP should store the least amount of data that you can get away with. Storing a reference to any object that is holding system resources open (particularly a database connection) is a definite scalability killer. Also, storing uncommitted data in a session variable is just a bad idea in most cases. Overall it sounds like the current implementation is abusively using session objects to try and simulate a stateful application in a supposedly stateless environment. </p>

<p>Although it is much maligned, the ASP.NET model of managing state automatically through hidden fields should really eliminate the majority of the need to keep anything in session variables.</p>

<p>My rule of thumb is that the more scalable (in terms of users/hits) that the app needs to be, the less you can get away with using session state. There is, however, a trade-off. For web applications where the user is repeatedly accessing the same data and typically has a fairly long session per use of the site, some caching (if necessary in session objects) can actually help scalability by reducing the load on the DB server. The idea here is that it is much cheaper and less complex to farm the presentation layer than the back-end DB. Of course, with all things, this advice should be taken in moderation and doesn't apply in all situations, but for a fairly simple in-house CRUD app, it should serve you well.</p>

I look at the suggestions above and they are very instrumental (if not blatantly horrific like the gentleman who recently suggested Atlas Shrugged, a tome of utterly abhorrent writing if there ever was one). The Mythical Man Month is indeed an interesting work but it's not that far removed from our daily business. And I am quite convinced that the imagination needs to be fed as well. Murakami is interesting in that he takes very recognizable situations and twists them around, turns them on their head and spits them back out. And sometimes that is just what we need. There's nothing wrong with winning friends and influencing people. But seriously. Is that the one book you should read when not pouring over some dry text about the benefit of some crap or the other. No. Remember what the door mouse said.</p>

<p>If your use-cases never require updates to both databases within the same transaction, then you can use two JpaTransactionManagers, but I'm not sure you will be able to use the @Transactional approach? In this case, you would need to fallback on the older mechanism of using a simple <a href=""http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionProxyFactoryBean.html"">TransactionProxyFactoryBean</a> to define transaction boundaries, eg:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""firstRealService"" class=""com.acme.FirstServiceImpl""/&gt;
&lt;bean id=""firstService""  
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""transactionManager"" ref=""firstJpaTm""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""target"" ref=""firstRealService""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""transactionAttributes""&gt;
        &lt;props&gt;
           &lt;prop key=""insert*""&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED&lt;/prop&gt;
           &lt;prop key=""update*""&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED&lt;/prop&gt;
           &lt;prop key=""*""&gt;PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly&lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;/props&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;!-- similar for your second service --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are require a transaction spanning both databases, then you will need to use a JTA transaction manager. The <a href=""http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.5/api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/JpaTransactionManager.html"">API</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. Note that you need to configure your JPA provider accordingly in order to make it participate in JTA transactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that you will need to provide a JTA transaction manager. In our application, we use config similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager=""txManager""/&gt;

&lt;bean id=""txManager"" 
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""transactionManagerName"" value=""appserver/jndi/path"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are deploying within an appserver, then the spring JtaTransactionManager needs to do a lookup to the real XA-compliant JTA transaction manager provided by the appserver. However, you can also use a standalone JTA transaction manager (but I haven't tried this myself yet)</p>

<p>As for configuring the Jpa persistence provider, I'm not that familiar. What JPA persistence provider are you using?</p>

<p>The code above is based on our approach, where we were using native Hibernate as opposed to Hibernate's JPA implementation. In this case, we were able to get rid of the two HibernateTransactionManager beans, and simply ensure that both SessionFactories were injected with the same JTA TM, and then use the tx:annotation-driven element.</p>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

79295,1539,2008-09-17T02:29:52Z,34920,1,"<p>My goal in this question was to lock a file being used as a data store for several scripts. In the end I used similar code to the following (from Chris):</p>

<pre><code>open (FILE, '&gt;&gt;', test.dat') ; # open the file 
flock FILE, 2; # try to lock the file 
# do something with the file here 
close(FILE); # close the file
</code></pre>

<p>In his example I removed the flock FILE, 8 as the close(FILE) performs this action as well. The real problem was when the script starts it has to hold the current counter, and when it ends it has to update the counter. This is where Perl has a problem, to read the file you:</p>

<pre><code> open (FILE, '&lt;', test.dat');
 flock FILE, 2;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to write out the results and since i want to overwrite the file I need to reopen and truncate which results in the following:</p>

<pre><code> open (FILE, '&gt;', test.dat'); #single arrow truncates double appends
 flock FILE, 2;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case the file is actually unlocked for a short period of time while the file is reopened. This demonstrates the case for the external lock file. If you are going to be changing contexts of the file, use a lock file. The modified code:</p>

<pre><code>open (LOCK_FILE, '&lt;', test.dat.lock') or die ""Could not obtain lock"";
flock LOCK_FILE, 2;
open (FILE, '&lt;', test.dat') or die ""Could not open file"";

79845,13940,2008-09-17T04:02:23Z,4080,60,"<p>For static analysis tools I often use CPD, <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net"">PMD</a>, <a href=""http://findbugs.sourceforge.net"">FindBugs</a>, and <a href=""http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net"">Checkstyle</a>.</p>

<p><p>CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html"">""Finding Duplicated Code"" link</a> on the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net"">PMD web page</a>.</p>

<p><p>I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href=""http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html"">""designer"" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href=""http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken"">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>

<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href=""http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup"">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>

<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity"">here</a>)</p>

<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>

<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>

<p><p>This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>

<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>

<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html"">filterchains</a>.</p>

<p><p>The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""<code>SuppressWarning</code>?""</p>

<p><p>For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""<code>NOPMD</code>"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>"" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>

<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>

<p><p>Only the ""<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>"" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>

<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>

<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" and ""<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>"" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>

<pre>
<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>
<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>
</pre>

<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own ""<code>BEGIN/END</code>"" comment pair.</p>

<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR"")</code></pre>

<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""<code>SuppressWarnings</code>"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>

""What is the overhead associated with using C# Delegates and Events?""</p>

<p>Events have little significant overhead in comparison to a regular function call.</p>

<p>The use of Delegates can create implicit and thus hidden garbage.  Garbage can be a major cause performance problems especially on the XBox360.</p>

<p>The following code generates around 2000 bytes of garbage per second (at 60 fps) in the form of EntityVisitor objects:</p>

<pre><code>    private delegate void SpacialItemVisitor(ISpacialItem item);

    protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
    {
        m_quadTree.Visit(ref explosionCircle, ApplyExplosionEffects);
    }

    private void ApplyExplosionEffects(ISpacialItem item)
    {
    }

<pre><code>substr($string, 0, strpos(wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width), ""\n""));
</code></pre>

<p>One thing this oneliner doesn't handle is the case when the text itself is shorter than the desired width. To handle this edge-case, one should do something like:</p>

<pre><code>if (strlen($string) &gt; $your_desired_width)

    $string = wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width);
    $string = substr($string, 0, strpos($string, ""\n""));

    if ($length &gt; $your_desired_width) { break; }
  }

  return implode(array_slice($parts, 0, $last_part));
}

<p>Also, here is the PHPUnit testclass used to test the implementation:</p>

<pre><code>class TokenTruncateTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
  public function testBasic() {
    $this-&gt;assertEquals(""1 3 5 7 9 "",
      tokenTruncate(""1 3 5 7 9 11 14"", 10));

<li>Build Agents. It's very simple to turn any box into a build machine and run a build on it. MSFT got this one right.</li>
<li>Reporting. All relevant build results (test included) are stored in a SQL database and reported on via SQL Server Reporting Services. This is an immensely powerful tool for charting build and test results over time. CC Net doesn't have this built in.</li>
<li>You can do similar customizations via MSBUILD. It's basically the same as using NAnt with CC Net</li>

<p><strong>Here's what drives me up the wall about Team Foundation Build:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To build C++/CLI projects (or run unit tests...?) the build agent must have VSTS Dev or Team Suite installed. This, friends, is just batsh*t crazy.</li>
<li>It must be connected to the TFS Mothership</li>

<ul>
<li>The access patterns you will be using and how often each will be used</li>
<li>The relationships between your types</li>
<li>What indices you are going to need</li>
<li>The write patterns you will be using (in order to effectively spread load)</li>

<p>GAE's datastore automatically denormalizes your data. That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.</p>

<p>If this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment's key would probably begin with the associated post's key.</p>

<p>With Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like ""Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N."" (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of "" AND comment_id > last_comment_id"".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.</p>

<p>Something to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.</p>

Also, a malicious user could simply enter text without any spaces, or using some Unicode look-alike to the standard space character, in which case any solution you use may end up displaying the entire text anyway. A way around this may be to check the string length after splitting it on spaces as normal, then, if the string is still above an abnormal limit - maybe 225 characters in this case - going ahead and splitting it dumbly at that limit.</p>

<p>One more caveat with things like this when it comes to non-ASCII characters; strings containing them may be interpreted by PHP's standard strlen() as being longer than they really are, because a single character may take two or more bytes instead of just one.

<p>I wrote the <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/TFSCCNetPlugin/"">CruiseControl.NET integration for TFS</a>.  It works fine and gives you the same build capabilities that you are used to. To me, CC.NET's main advantage is that it is completely extensible and has integrations with all the major SCM and build systems under the sun. The main reason I wrote the CC.NET integration to TFS it is that in TFS2005 the build system did not have out-the-box CI support.  However the TFS2008 version is much improved and the team continue to very actively improve it for future releases of TFS.</p>

<p>The main reason for switching to TFS Build would be so that it automatically reports the build information back into TFS which helps complete the software development picture in terms of reporting.  It also integrates nicely with the work item tracking side of TFS and inside the IDE (both in Visual Studio and Eclipse).</p>

It uses the standard compiler &amp; debugger (gcc, g++, gdb) on Linux and the MS compiler/debugger on that platform.<br /><br />The only (very small) gripe I have is the home-made names for projects (called Nest's &amp; so forth).

<blockquote>
  <p>The Java specification says that the
  phantom reference is not cleared when
  the reference object is enqueued, but
  actually, there's no way in the
  language to tell whether that has been
  done or not. In some implementations,
  JNI weak global references are weaker
  than phantom references, and provide a
  way to access phantom reachable
  objects.</p>

"
80858,15241,2008-09-17T07:40:59Z,80690,-2,"<p>It can allow you two have phantom caches which are very efficient in memory management.
Simply put, if you have huge objects that are expensive to create but seldom used, you can use a phantom cache to reference them and be sure they do not take up memory that is more valuable.  If you use regular references you have to be manually make sure there are no references left to the object.  You can argue the same about any object but you dont have to manually manage the references in your phantom cache.  Just have to be carefull to check if they have been collected or not.</p>

<p>Also you can use a framework (i.e. a factory) where references are given as phantom references.  This is useful if the objects are many and short lived (i.e. used and then disposed).  Very handy for clearing memory if you have sloppy programmers that think garbage collection is magical.</p>
"
80867,15255,2008-09-17T07:42:39Z,80690,1,"<p>I think the idea is to let other objects do extra cleanup above and beyond what the original object does. For example, if the original object cannot be extended to implement some finalization stuff, you can use phantom references.</p>

<p>The bigger problem is that the JVM makes no guarantee that an object will ever be finalized, and I assume by extension no guarantee that phantom references get to do their thing post-finalization.</p>

These are general purpose code to sort arrays and to search for data in a pre-sorted array.  They work on any type of data structure - but you pass them a pointer to a helper function that does the comparisons.  The helper function knows the details of the structure, and therefore does the comparison correctly.</p>

<p>In fact, since you are wanting to do searches, it may be that all you need is bsearch(), though if you are building the data structures on the fly, you may decide you need a different structure than a sorted list.  (You can use sorted lists -- it just tends to slow things down compared with, say, a heap.  However, you'd need a general heap_search() function, and a heap_insert() function, to do the job properly, and such functions are not standardized in C.   Searching the web shows such functions exist - not by that name; just do not try ""c heap search"" since it is assumed you meant ""cheap search"" and you get tons of junk!)</p>

Unit tests are isolated and you won't actually know if you have ""unwanted, obscure side-effects"" because everything is walled off from the other things that cause the side effects.  As a result, you need integration or system testing and <em>that</em> is not something you can automate.</p>

<p>Build a few high-level, end-to-end system tests which give you a degree of confidence and then use coverage testing to find out what you've missed,  The downside is that when bugs crop up, it will be harder to point to their exact cause, but the upside is that you'll be far more likely to see the bugs.</p>

<p>Once you find bugs, write unit tests just for them.  As you move forward, you can use TDD for the bits you want to refactor.</p>

<p>One-JAR uses a custom class-loader which can navigate nested resources. Look at the .bat file in the download, it looks like org.codelutin.jrst.JRST in the jrst-0.8.1.jar is the main class, so your manifest should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Main-Class: com.simontuffs.onejar.Boot
One-Jar-Main-Class: org.codelutin.jrst.JRST

<h2>Using namespace</h2>

<p>Namespaces are used at the very least to help avoid name collision. In Java, this is enforced through the ""org.domain"" idiom (because it is supposed one won't use anything else than his/her own domain name).</p>

<p>In C++, you could give a namespace to all the code in your module. For example, for a module MyModule.dll, you could give its code the namespace MyModule. I've see elsewhere someone using MyCompany::MyProject::MyModule. I guess this is overkill, but all in all, it seems correct to me.</p>

<h2>Using ""using""</h2>

<p>Using should be used with great care because it effectively import one (or all) symbols from a namespace into your current namespace.</p>

<p>This is evil to do it in a header file because your header will pollute every source including it (it reminds me of macros...), and even in a source file, bad style outside a function scope because it will import at global scope the symbols from the namespace.</p>

<p>The most secure way to use ""using"" is to  import select symbols:</p>

<pre><code>void doSomething()
{
   using std::string ; // string is now ""imported"", at least,
                       // until the end of the function
   string a(""Hello World"") ;
   std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl ;
}

void doSomethingElse()
{
   using namespace std ; // everything from std is now ""imported"", at least,
                       // until the end of the function
   string a(""Hello World"") ;
   cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll see a lot of ""using namespace std ;"" in tutorial or example codes. The reason is to reduce the number of symbols to make the reading easier, not because it is a good idea.</p>

<p>""using namespace std ;"" is discouraged by Scott Meyers (I don't remember exactly which book, but I can find it if necessary).</p>

<h2>Namespace Composition</h2>

<p>Namespaces are more than packages. Another example can be found in Bjarne Stroustrup's ""The C++ Programming Language"".</p>

<p>In the ""Special Edition"", at <strong>8.2.8 Namespace Composition</strong>, he describes how you can merge two namespaces AAA and BBB into another one called CCC. Thus CCC becomes an alias for both AAA and BBB:</p>

<pre><code>namespace AAA
{
   void doSomething() ;
}

namespace BBB
{
   void doSomethingElse() ;
}

namespace CCC
{
   using namespace AAA ;
   using namespace BBB ;
}

void doSomethingAgain()
{
   CCC::doSomething() ;
   CCC::doSomethingElse() ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could even import select symbols from different namespaces, to build your own custom namespace interface. I have yet to find a practical use of this, but in theory, it is cool.</p>

<p>see notify_of_job_status() in jobs.c.</p>

<p>As you say, you can redirect so standard error is pointing to /dev/null but then you miss any other error messages.  You can make it temporary by doing the redirection in a subshell which runs the script.  This leaves the original environment alone.</p>

<pre><code>(script 2&gt; /dev/null)
</code></pre>

<p>which will lose all error messages, but just from that script, not from anything else run in that shell.</p>

<p>You can save and restore standard error, by redirecting a new filedescriptor to point there:</p>

<pre><code>exec 3&gt;&amp;2          # 3 is now a copy of 2
exec 2&gt; /dev/null  # 2 now points to /dev/null
script             # run script with redirected stderr
exec 2&gt;&amp;3          # restore stderr to saved
exec 3&gt;&amp;-          # close saved version

  real[i] = 0;

At the time Type 1 and Type 3 were the only formats understood by PostScript printers, and only Type 1 could include hints needed to make fonts look good, and the format was a trade secret. This way Adobe relegated other font foundries to non-hinted fonts using Type 3 format.</p>

<p>TrueType was invented by Microsoft as a way (a) to break Adobe's monopoly on hinted font formats, (b) to avoid using a format associated with the Macintosh and PostScript on Windows. Internally TrueType used quadratic curves rather than cubic beziers, thus making them faster to render on the screen and on the cheaper non-PostScript-capable printeres used on Windows sytems. TrueType also has better support for Unicode and other things invented since the creation of Type 1. Modern Macs support TrueType as well.</p>

<p>The new format OpenType combines TrueType and Type 1 (the vector data is permitted to be in quadratic or cubic form, so you can directly convert either of the old formats to the OpenType). OpenType also has support for fancy automatic ligatures and glyph substitution, which is nice in English text and vital for text using Arabic or Indian scripts. </p>

<p>TrueType fonts were defined by Apple a couple of years earlier so True Type and PostScript were competitors in the 1990s. Microsoft picked up True Type for the native Windows font format in the beginning 1990s (for using PostScript, additional tools like Adobe Type manager were necessary). </p>

<p>Today, Microsoft is fading out support for PostScript fonts. Try using one as an UI font in Vista. Good luck ;-)</p>

<p>As a successor of TrueType, Microsoft (I think together with Adobe) created the Open Type (anytime around 2000) format and Adobe converted their whole font library into the new format (you can still get them as Type-1 fonts). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>F# is a typed functional programming language for the .NET Framework. It combines the succinctness, expressivity, and compositionality of typed functional programming with the runtime support, libraries, interoperability, tools and object model of .NET. F# stems from the ML family of languages and has a core language compatible with that of OCaml, though also draws from C# and Haskell. F# was designed from the ground up to be a first-class citizen on .NET, giving smooth interoperability with other .NET languages. For example, C# and F# can call each other directly. This means that F# has immediate access to all the .NET Framework APIs, including, for example, Windows Presentation Foundation and DirectX. Similarly, libraries developed in F# may be used from other .NET languages. </p>
  
  <p>Since F# and OCaml share a similar core language, some OCaml libraries and applications can cross-compile either directly or with minor conditionally-compiled changes. This provides a path to cross-compile and/or port existing OCaml code to .NET, and also allows programmers to transfer skills between these languages. A major focus of the project has been to extend the reach of OCaml-like languages into arenas where they have not traditionally been used. Throughout the project the designers of F# are grateful for the support and encouragement of Xavier Leroy and others in the OCaml community. </p>

Finalizers have a horrible impact on the performance of the garbage collector and can break data integrity of your application if you're not very careful since the ""finalizer"" is invoked in a random thread, at a random time.<br><br>

In the constructor of a phantom reference, you specify a ReferenceQueue where the phantom references are enqueued once the referenced objects becomes ""phantom reachable"". Phantom reachable means unreachable other than through the phantom reference. The initially confusing thing is that although the phantom reference continues to hold the referenced object in a private field (unlike soft or weak references), its getReference() method always returns null. This is so that you cannot make the object strongly reachable again.<br><br>

From time to time, you can poll the ReferenceQueue and check if there are any new PhantomReferences whose referenced objects have become phantom reachable. In order to be able to to anything useful, one can for example derive a class from java.lang.ref.PhantomReference that references resources that should be freed before garbage collection. The referenced object is only garbage collected once the phantom reference becomes unreachable itself.</blockquote>

I would recommend the <a href=""http://www.rebex.net/file-transfer-pack/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rebex File Transfer Pack</a> - it supports both FTP (and FTP/SSL) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer).</p>

<p>Following code shows how to upload a file to the server via SFTP. The code is taken from our <a href=""http://www.rebex.net/sftp.net/tutorial-sftp.aspx#upload-download"" rel=""nofollow"">Rebex SFTP tutorial page</a>.</p>

<pre><code>// create client, connect and log in 
Sftp client = new Sftp();
client.Connect(hostname);
client.Login(username, password);

// upload the 'test.zip' file to the current directory at the server 
client.PutFile(@""c:\data\test.zip"", ""test.zip"");

// upload the 'index.html' file to the specified directory at the server 
client.PutFile(@""c:\data\index.html"", ""/wwwroot/index.html"");

// download the 'test.zip' file from the current directory at the server 
client.GetFile(""test.zip"", @""c:\data\test.zip"");

// download the 'index.html' file from the specified directory at the server 
client.GetFile(""/wwwroot/index.html"", @""c:\data\index.html"");

// upload a text using a MemoryStream 
string message = ""Hello from Rebex SFTP for .NET!"";
byte[] data = System.Text.Encoding.Default.GetBytes(message);
System.IO.MemoryStream ms = new System.IO.MemoryStream(data);
client.PutFile(ms, ""message.txt"");

<p>After a short time learning and experimenting with ruby or perl you should be able to write some regex manipulating scripts that can alter data formats or grab information from logs.   An example of a small ruby/perl script that could be written quickly would be a script to parse a very large log file and report out only a few events of interest in either a human readable format or a csv format. </p>

<p>As for tasks, Python/Lua/Ruby/Perl are great for small simple tasks, like finding some files and renaming them.

An example: a simple script in perl to go through a large text file and replace all instances of an email address with another is trivial with an amount of time taken in the 10 minute range. Hacking a console app together to do the same in your main language would take multiples of that.</p>

<p>You also have the benefit that exposing yourself to additional languages broadens your abilities and learning to attack problems from a different languages perspective can be as valuable as the language itself.</p>

<p>Finally, scripting languages are very useful in the realm of extension. Take LUA as an example. You can bolt a lua interpreter into your app with very little overhead and you now have a way to create rich scripting functionality that can be exposed to end users or altered and distributed quickly without requiring a rebuild of the entire app. This is used to great effect in many games most notably World of Warcraft.</p>

84943,16219,2008-09-17T16:17:05Z,84340,78,"<p>A lot of times some quick task comes up that isn't part of the main software you are developing.  Sometimes the task is one off ie compare this file to the database and let me know the differences.  It is a lot easier to do text parsing in Perl/Ruby/Python than it is in Java or C# (partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions).  It will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using Perl/Ruby/Python (or maybe even vbscript <em>cringe</em> and then load it into the database than it would to create a Java/C# program to do it or to do it by hand.</p>

<p>Also, due to the ease at which most of the dynamic languages parse text, they are great for code generation.  Sure your final project must be in C#/Java/Transact SQL but instead of cutting and pasting 100 times, finding errors, and cutting and pasting another 100 times it is often (but not always) easier just to use a code generator.</p>

<p>A recent example at work is we needed to get data from one accounting system into our accounting system.  The system has an import format, but the old system had a completely different format (fixed width although some things had to be matched).  The task is not to create a program to migrate the data over and over again.  It is to shove the data into our system and then maintain it there going forward.  So even though we are a C# and SQL Server shop, I used Python to convert the data into the format that could be imported by our application.  Ultimately it doesn't matter that I used python, it matters that the data is in the system.  My boss was pretty impressed.</p>

<p>Where I often see the dynamic languages used for is testing.  It is much easier to create a Python/Perl/Ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent Java program.  You can also use python to hit against command line programs, generate a ton of garbage (but still valid) test data, etc.. quite easily.</p>

<p>The other thing that dynamic languages are big on is code generation.  Creating the C#/C++/Java code.  Some examples follow:</p>

<p>The first code generation task I often see is people using dynamic languages to maintain constants in the system.  Instead of hand coding a bunch of enums, a dynamic language can be used to fairly easily parse a text file and create the Java/C# code with the enums.</p>

<p>SQL is a whole other ball game but often you get better performance by cut and pasting 100 times instead of trying to do a function (due to caching of execution plans or putting complicated logic in a function causing you to go row by row instead of in a set).  In fact it is quite useful to use the table definition to create certain stored procedures automatically.</p>

<p>It is always better to get buy in for a code generator.  But even if you don't, is it more fun to spend time cutting/pasting or is it more fun to create a Perl/Python/Ruby script once and then have that generate the code?  If it takes you hours to hand code something but less time to create a code generator, then even if you use it once you have saved time and hence money.  If it takes you longer to create a code generator than it takes to hand code once but you know you will have to update the code more than once, it may still make sense.  If it takes you 2 hours to hand code, 4 hours to do the generator but you know you'll have to hand code equivalent work another 5 or 6 times than it is obviously better to create the generator.</p>

<p>Also some things are easier with dynamic languages than Java/C#/C/C++.  In particular regular expressions come to mind.  If you start using regular expressions in Perl and realize their value, you may suddenly start making use of the Java regular expression library if you haven't before.  If you have then there may be something else.</p>

<p>I will leave you with one last example of a task that would have been great for a dynamic language.  My work mate had to take a directory full of files and burn them to various cd's for various customers.  There were a few customers but a lot of files and you had to look in them to see what they were.  He did this task by hand....A Java/C# program would have saved time, but for one time and with all the development overhead it isn't worth it.  However slapping something together in Perl/Python/Ruby probably would have been worth it.  He spent several hours doing it.  It would have taken less than one to create the Python script to inspect each file, match which customer it goes to, and then move the file to the appropriate place.....Again, not part of the standard job.  But the task came up as a one off.  Is it better to do it yourself, spend the larger amount of time to make Java/C# do the task, or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in Python/Perl/Ruby.  If you are using C or C++ the point is even more dramatic due to the extra concerns of programming in C or C++ (pointers, no array bounds checking, etc.).</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of confusion over OpenID.  Its original goal was simply to provide a standard login mechanism so that, when I need a secure login mechanism, I can select from any or all OpenID providers to handle that for me.  Allowing anyone anywhere to set up their own trusted OpenID <em>provider</em> was never the goal.  Doing the second effectively is impossible&mdash;after all, even with encryption, there's no reason you can't set up your own provider to securely lie and say it's authenticating whomever you want.

<p>You'll notice that there are a few bits in there that you might not need.</p>

<p>For example, my app needed to retain the successfully-logged-in LDAP context for further use by the user once logged in -- the app's purpose is to let users log in via their AD credentials and then perform further AD-related functions.  So because of that, I have a custom authentication token, LdapAuthenticationToken, that I pass around (rather than Spring's default Authentication token) which allows me to attach the LDAP context.  In LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I create that token and pass it back out; in LdapAuthenticatorImpl.authenticate(), I attach the logged-in context to the return object so that it can be added to the user's Spring authentication object.</p>

<p>Also, in LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I assign all logged-in users the ROLE_USER role -- that's what lets me then test for that role in my intercept-url elements.  You'll want to make this match whatever role you want to test for, or even assign roles based on Active Directory groups or whatever.</p>

<p>Finally, and a corollary to that, the way I implemented LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate() gives all users with valid AD accounts the same ROLE_USER role.  Obviously, in that method, you can perform further tests on the user (i.e., is the user in a specific AD group?) and assign roles that way, or even test for some condition before even granting the user access at <em>all</em>.</p>

"
86518,9654,2008-09-17T19:10:46Z,86090,2,"<p>Notice that unlike conventional ""per site"" logins, OpenID gives you an identity that potentially transcends individual sites. Better yet, this identity is even a URI so its perfect for using with RDF to exchange or query arbitrary metadata about the identity.</p>

<p>You can do a few things with an OpenID that you can't do with a conventional username from a new user.</p>

<p>Firstly you can do some simple whitelist operations. If *.bigcorp.example are OpenIDs from Big Corp employees and you know Big Corp aren't spammers, then you can whitelist those OpenIDs. This ought to work well for sites that are semi-closed, maybe it's a social site for current and past employees.</p>

<p>Better though, you can make inferences from the other places that specific OpenID has been used. Suppose you have a map of OpenIDs to reputation values from Stackoverflow.com. When someone shows up at your web forum with an OpenID, you can see if they have decent reputation at Stackoverflow and skip the CAPTCHA or probationary period for those users.</p>

<h2>Update Following Comment from OP</h2>

<p>Looking at your question, you said that ""some"" are special, and in your diagram, you have different nodes looking differently at different levels. The nodes may be different in their design, you can build a tree structure many ways. For example, a single abstract class that <em>can</em> have child nodes, if no children, its a leaf, if no parent, its a root but this can change in its lifetime. Or, a fixed class structure in which leafs are a specific class type that <em>cannot</em> have children added to them in any way.</p>

<p>IF your design does not need you to distinguish nodes differently depending on their position (relative to the root) it suggests that you have an abstract class used for them all.</p>

<p>In which case, it raises the question, <strong>how is it different?</strong> </p>

<p>If it is simply the same as the standard node everywhere else, but with a bit of styling, how about <em>StyledNode</em>? Do you even need it to be seperate (no style == no big deal, it doesn't render).</p>

<p>Since I don't know the mechanics of how the tree is architected, there could possibly be several factors to consider when naming.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the first few lines of the stylesheet, called the style sheet header, for the Theme ""Rose"":</p>

<pre><code>/*   
Theme Name: Rose
Theme URI: the-theme's-homepage
Description: a-brief-description
Author: your-name
Author URI: your-URI
Template: use-this-to-define-a-parent-theme--optional
Version: a-number--optional
Tags: a-comma-delimited-list--optional
.
General comments/License Statement if any.
.
*/
</code></pre>

<p>The simplest Theme includes only a style.css file, plus images, if any. To create such a Theme, you must specify a set of templates to inherit for use with the Theme by editing the Template: line in the style.css header comments. For example, if you wanted the Theme ""Rose"" to inherit the templates from another Theme called ""test"", you would include Template: test in the comments at the beginning of Rose's style.css. Now ""test"" is the parent Theme for ""Rose"", which still consists only of a style.css file and the concomitant images, all located in the directory wp-content/themes/Rose. (Note that specifying a parent Theme will inherit all of the template files from that Theme â meaning that any template files in the child Theme's directory will be ignored.)</p>

<p>The comment header lines in style.css are required for WordPress to be able to identify a Theme and display it in the Administration Panel under Design > Themes as an available Theme option along with any other installed Themes. </p>

<p>The Theme Name, Version, Author, and Author URI fields are parsed by WordPress and used to display that data in the Current Theme area on the top line of the current theme information, where the Author's Name is hyperlinked to the Author URI.  The Description and Tag fields are parsed and displayed in the body of the theme's information, and if the theme has a parent theme, that information is placed in the information body as well.  In the Available Themes section, only the Theme Name, Description, and Tags fields are used.</p>

<p>None of these fields have any restrictions - all are parsed as strings.  In addition, none of them are required in code, though in practice the fields not marked as optional in the list above are all used to provide contextual information to the WordPress administrator and should be included for all themes.</p>

<p>i sense there is something horribly wrong with this code. The GetHashCode method does not guarantee, that the returned hash values should be in any way unique given two different objects. As far as GetHashCode is concerned, it can return 0 for all objects and still be considered correct.</p>

<p>When two object are the same (the Equals method returns true), they <strong>MUST</strong> have the same value returned from GetHashCode. When two objects have the same hash value, they <strong>can</strong> be the same object (Equals returns true) or be different objects (Equals returns false).</p>

<p>There are no other guarantees on the result of GetHashCode.</p>

<p>The default implementation of GetHashCode in Object class return a hash value based on objects address in memory or something similar. If some other identity comparison is required, you <strong>have to</strong> override both Equals and GetHashCode.</p>

<pre><code>c:\&gt; FindStr /?

Searches for strings in files.

FINDSTR [/B] [/E] [/L] [/R] [/S] [/I] [/X] [/V] [/N] [/M] [/O] [/P] [/F:file]
        [/C:string] [/G:file] [/D:dir list] [/A:color attributes] [/OFF[LINE]]
        strings [[drive:][path]filename[ ...]]

  /B         Matches pattern if at the beginning of a line.
  /E         Matches pattern if at the end of a line.
  /L         Uses search strings literally.
  /R         Uses search strings as regular expressions.
  /S         Searches for matching files in the current directory and all
             subdirectories.
  /I         Specifies that the search is not to be case-sensitive.
  /X         Prints lines that match exactly.
  /V         Prints only lines that do not contain a match.
  /N         Prints the line number before each line that matches.
  /M         Prints only the filename if a file contains a match.
  /O         Prints character offset before each matching line.
  /P         Skip files with non-printable characters.
  /OFF[LINE] Do not skip files with offline attribute set.
  /A:attr    Specifies color attribute with two hex digits. See ""color /?""
  /F:file    Reads file list from the specified file(/ stands for console).
  /C:string  Uses specified string as a literal search string.
  /G:file    Gets search strings from the specified file(/ stands for console).
  /D:dir     Search a semicolon delimited list of directories
  strings    Text to be searched for.
  [drive:][path]filename
             Specifies a file or files to search.

Use spaces to separate multiple search strings unless the argument is prefixed
with /C.  For example, 'FINDSTR ""hello there"" x.y' searches for ""hello"" or
""there"" in file x.y.  'FINDSTR /C:""hello there"" x.y' searches for
""hello there"" in file x.y.

Regular expression quick reference:
  .        Wildcard: any character
  *        Repeat: zero or more occurances of previous character or class
  ^        Line position: beginning of line
  $        Line position: end of line
  [class]  Character class: any one character in set
  [^class] Inverse class: any one character not in set
  [x-y]    Range: any characters within the specified range
  \x       Escape: literal use of metacharacter x
  \&lt;xyz    Word position: beginning of word
  xyz\&gt;    Word position: end of word

<p><a href=""http://www.interactive-technology.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">ActiveDeveloper</a> - doesn't appear to have active support (last update was in 2006). Mac only.</p>

<p>KDevelop sounds like it only supports Objective-C syntax and only through its C support. I'm going to check it out anyway.</p>

<p>Textmate has a couple screencasts for Objective-C (<a href=""http://macromates.com/screencast/objective-c_part_1.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://macromates.com/screencast/objective_c_part_2.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). It is Mac only, but otherwise looks pretty good. It is hard to tell from the screencast how strong the integrated support is as it seems to just have a lot of scripts to handle the code. Also, I can't tell if it does true code completion or just expansion for snippets.</p>

<p>So it doesn't look like there is anything out there that hits everything. I'll probably do most of my development on Mac, so I'm thinking I'll try out TextMate with XCode to see if it is any better than straight XCode. I'll take a quick look at KDevelop.</p>

"
88226,NA,2008-09-17T22:12:41Z,88030,0,"<p>A tried and tested way I have used is to design a settings container class. 
This container class can have sub-classes for different types of setting categories.
It works well since you reference your ""settings"" via property name and therefore if something changes in future, you will get compile time errors. It is also expandible, since you can always create new settings by adding more properties to your individual setting classes and assign default values to the private variable of a property that will be used should that specific setting not exist in an older version of your application. Once the new container is saved, the new settings will be persisted as well.
Another advantage is the obvious human / computer readability of XML which is nice for settings. </p>

<p>To save, serialize the container object to XML data, then write the data to file. To load, read the data from file and deserialize back into your settings container class.</p>

<p>To serialize via standard C# code:</p>

<pre><code>public static string SerializeToXMLString(object ObjectToSerialize)
MemoryStream mem = new MemoryStream();          
System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer ser = new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(ObjectToSerialize.GetType());
ser.Serialize(mem,ObjectToSerialize);                       
ASCIIEncoding ascii = new ASCIIEncoding();
return ascii.GetString(mem.ToArray());
</code></pre>

<p>To deserialize via standard C# code:</p>

<pre><code>public static object DeSerializeFromXMLString(System.Type TypeToDeserialize, string xmlString)
byte[] bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(xmlString);
MemoryStream mem = new MemoryStream(bytes);         
System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer ser = new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(TypeToDeserialize);
return ser.Deserialize(mem);
</code></pre>

<p>Once last nice thing about a serializable settings class is because it is an object, you can use IntelliSense to quickly navigate to a particular setting.</p>

<p>Note: After you instantiated your settings container class, you should make it a static property of another static managing class (you can call it SettingsManager if you want)
This managing class allows you to access your settings from anywhere in your application (since its static) and you can also have static functions to handle the loading and saving of the class.</p>

88508,12975,2008-09-17T22:56:24Z,87290,0,"<p>I wasn't aware of that limitation.  Although it does make sense to disable potentially data-hefty OBJECT or EMBED tags when on the cellular data service for which your provider may be charging by the byte, if that were the reason it wouldn't make sense that it would still work on 3G and only not on GPRS.<br />
Perhaps the problem is one of basic data throughput?  Not having an iPhone yourself (or myself) makes it difficult to test your colleague's statement.  <br />
Remember that GPRS is much slower than Wi-Fi or 3G.  According to Wikipedia, GPRS will provide between 56 and 114 kbps of total duplex throughput, not all of which is in the download direction.  You can already see that's not fast enough to instantly stream a typical 128 kbps mp3, even if you were getting the optimal throughput and getting it all as download speed.<br />
Looking at <a href=""http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies-archive.cfm/832797.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this forum discussion</a> as an example that came up on Google, the GPRS customers (the ones not using Telestra, which is an EDGE provider in that area) are getting around 40 kbps.  So if as the question implies, you're stuck in EDGEland, NOT 3Gland or anything inbetween, it's going to take about 20 seconds of buffering to play a 30 second mp3.  And when you use a behaviour-ambiguous tag like OBJECT or EMBED, there's no guarantee in how the browser will interpret it and whether it's going to try to intelligently stream the file rather than having to download the whole thing before starting it.<br />
So, it's quite possible your colleague just didn't wait long enough to see if whatever embedded media he chose as a test started to play (assuming he wasn't using your 17KB test mp3 there).  It's also possible that the iPhone does indeed have this limitation, though I'd think Google would be more forthcoming with it than my quick search uncovered, since people have been vocal enough with other things they don't like about iPhone.  Another possibility would be that it's a limitation in the build of Safari that currently ships with the iPhone which might be changed in future versions or in another browser.<br />
Ultimately though, the question is, what kind of user experience do you really want?  Embedded audio on GPRS is going to take a long time to load, and users aren't going to enjoy the experience, or potentially even experience it at all if it's supposed to start playing on page visit and it doesn't load before they navigate away.  It might not be a goal worth striving towards in that case.</p>

89436,4958,2008-09-18T02:19:55Z,88850,21,"<p>In general, as the (decision version of the) Hamiltonian Path problem is NP-complete, you cannot hope to get a polynomial-time algorithm for finding Hamiltonian paths. You can slightly speed it up with the usual N! &rarr; N<sup>2</sup>2<sup>N</sup> dynamic programming trick (compute hp[v][w][S] = ""is there a path that has endpoints v and w and whose vertices are the subset S"" for every subset S and every two vertices v and w in it using DP), but that's still exponential.</p>

<p>However, there are many special kinds of graphs for which Hamiltonian paths will always exist, and they can be found easily (see work of Posa, Dirac, Ore, etc.)</p>

<p>For instance, the following is true: <em>If every vertex of the graph has degree at least n/2</em>, then the graph has a Hamiltonian path. You can in fact find one in O(n<sup>2</sup>), or IIRC even O(n log n) if you do it more cleverly.<br/>
[Rough sketch: First, just connect all vertices in some ""Hamiltonian"" cycle, nevermind if the edges are actually in the graph. Now for every edge (v,w) of your cycle that is not actually in the graph, consider the rest of the cycle: v...w. As deg(v)+deg(w)>=n, there exist consecutive x,y in your list (in that order) such that w is a neighbour of x and v is a neighbour of y. [Proof: Consider {the set of all neighbours of w} and {the set of all successors in your list of neighbours of v}; they must intersect.] Now change your cycle [v...xy...wv] to [vy...wx...v] instead, it has at least one less invalid edge, so you'll need at most n iterations to get a true Hamiltonian cycle. More details <a href=""http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~perouz/cs251/documents/solutions6/solutions6.html"">here</a>.]</p>

<p>BTW: if what you are looking for is just a walk that includes every <em>edge</em> once, it's called an Eulerian walk and for graphs that have it (number of vertices of odd degree is 0 or 2), one can quite easily be found in polynomial time (fast).</p>

<li><p>Roll your own two phase commit. Application C acts as the coordinator. C signals A and B to ask if they're ready to commit. A and B do their processing, and respond to C with either a ""ready"" or a ""fail"" reply (note that there should be a timeout on C to avoid an infinite wait if one process hangs or dies). If both reply ready then C tells them to commit. Otherwise it sends a rollback signal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that you may run into issues with option 3 if app A is relying on foreign keys from app B (which you didn't state, so this may not be an issue). Oracle's read consistency would probably prevent this from being allowed, since app A's transaction will begin before app B. Just a warning.</p>

<li><p><strong>Prototyping</strong>- use RoR or Grails to build quick prototypes with advantage of being able to runn it on the standard app server and (maybe) reuse existing services etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Testing</strong>- right unit tests much much faster in dynamic languages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance/automation test scripting</strong>- some of these tools are starting to allow the use standard dynamic language of choice to write the test scripts instead of proprietary script languages.

90490,17294,2008-09-18T06:24:13Z,89620,4,"<p>I think the question is slightly confused as to terminology. A POJO (Plain Old Java Object) refers to a Java object unencumbered by dependencies on particular application servers or third party libraries. Using a good IOC (Inversion Of Control) framework, like Spring, allows you to write all your classes as POJOs so you can test them independently without having to start an app server in your test.</p>

<p>A Java bean is a simple Java class containing private attributes and public getBlah() and setBlah() accessor methods and not much else. Java beans are by nature POJOs.</p>

<p>So if the question was, ""Should I test my POJOs (which contain business logic)?"" the answer is emphatically yes.</p>

<p>If the question is, ""Should I test my Java beans (which are simple value objects with no behaviour)?"" the answer is probably not.</p>

90551,372,2008-09-18T06:42:05Z,90530,3,"<p>I think it boils down to the design of your objects. Because lazy-loading can be enforced in the per-object level, you can take advantage of that fact when you think about session management.</p>

<p>For example, I have a bunch of objects which are data-rich and lazy loaded, and I have a grid/summary view, and a details view for them. In the grid-summary view, I do not use the lazy-loaded version of the object. I use a surrogate object to present that data, and that surrogate object is not lazy loaded.</p>

<p>On the other hand, once a user selects that record for viewing/editing, and you enter a multi-paged details view of the object, that's when we apply lazy-loading to the specific object. Data is now lazy loaded depending on which details are viewed only on demand. That way, the scope of my session being open for lazy loading only lasts as long as the details view is being used.</p>

<li>preserving proper nouns? You mean, detecting named entities, like <em>Hoover</em> <em>Dam</em> and saying ""it's one word"" or compound nouns, like <em>programming</em> <em>language</em>?

<li>ignoring hyphenation? You mean, like at line breaks? Use regular expressions and verify the resulting word via dictionary lookup.</li>
<li>handling plurals/stemming: you can look into the <a href=""http://snowball.tartarus.org"">Snowball stemmer</a>. It does the trick nicely.</li>
<li>""grouping"" adjectives with their nouns is generally a task of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_parsing"">shallow parsing</a>. But if you are looking specifically for qualitative adjectives (good, bad, shitty, amazing...) you may be interested in <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sentiment_analysis"">sentiment analysis</a>. <a href=""http://alias-i.com/lingpipe"">LingPipe</a> does this, and a lot more.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sorry, I know you said you wanted to KISS, but unfortunately, your demands aren't that easy to meet. Nevertheless, there exist tools for all of this, and you should be able to just tie them together and not have to perform any task yourself, if you don't want to. If you want to perform a task yourself, I suggest you look at stemming, it's the easiest of all.</p>

<p>If you go with Java, combine <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org"">Lucene</a> with the <a href=""http://opennlp.sf.net"">OpenNLP</a> toolkit. You will get very good results, as Lucene already has a stemmer built in and a lot of tutorial. The OpenNLP toolkit on the other hand is poorly documented, but you won't need too much out of it. You might also be interested in <a href=""http://nltk.sf.net"">NLTK</a>, written in Python.</p>

<p>I would say you drop your last requirement, as it involves shallow parsing and will definetly not impove your results.</p>

<p>Ah, btw. the exact term of that document-term-frequency-thing you were looking for is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf"">tf-idf</a>. It's pretty much the best way to look for document frequency for terms. In order to do it properly, you won't get around using multidimenional vector matrices.</p>

<p>... Yes, I know. After taking a seminar on IR, my respect for Google was even greater. After doing some stuff in IR, my respect for them fell just as quick, though.</p>
"
90852,9401,2008-09-18T08:07:19Z,90580,2,"<p>The first part of your question doesn't sound so bad. All you basically need to do is read each word from the file (or stream w/e) and place it into a prefix tree and each time you happen upon a word that already exists you increment the value associated with it. Of course you would have an ignore list of everything you'd like left out of your calculations as well.</p>

<p>If you use a prefix tree you ensure that to find any word is going to O(N) where N is the maximum length of a word in your data set. The advantage of a prefix tree in this situation is that if you want to look for plurals and stemming you can check in O(M+1) if that's even possible for the word, where M is the length of the word without stem or plurality (is that a word? hehe). Once you've built your prefix tree I would reanalyze it for the stems and such and condense it down so that the root word is what holds the results.</p>

<p>Upon searching you could have some simple rules in place to have the match return positive in case of the root or stem or what have you.</p>

<p>The second part seems extremely challenging. My naive inclination would be to hold separate results for adjective-subject groupings. Use the same principles as above but just keep it separate.</p>

<p>Another option for the semantic analysis could be modeling each sentence as a tree of subject, verb, etc relationships (Sentence has a subject and verb, subject has a noun and adjective, etc). Once you've broken all of your text up in this way it seems like it might be fairly easy to run through and get a quick count of the different appropriate pairings that occurred.</p>

<p>Just some ramblings, I'm sure there are better ideas, but I love thinking about this stuff.</p>

90890,8146,2008-09-18T08:17:37Z,90580,15,"<p>Welcome to the world of NLP ^_^</p>

<p>All you need is a little basic knowledge and some tools.</p>

<p>There are already tools that will tell you if a word in a sentence is a noun, adjective or verb. They are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging"">part-of-speech taggers</a>. Typically, they take plaintext English as input, and output the word, its base form, and the part-of-speech. Here is the output of a popular UNIX part-of-speech tagger on the first sentence of your post:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""Without getting a degree in information retrieval, I'd like to know if there exists any algorithms for counting the frequency that words occur in a given body of text."" | tree-tagger-english 
# Word  POS 	surface form
Without IN	without

degree  NN	degree
in  IN	in

given   VVN	give
body    NN	body
of  IN	of
text    NN	text
.   SENT	.
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it identified ""algorithms"" as being the plural form (NNS) of ""algorithm"" and ""exists"" as being a conjugation (VBZ) of ""exist."" It also identified ""a"" and ""the"" as ""determiners (DT)"" -- another word for article. As you can see, the POS tagger also tokenized the punctuation.</p>

<p>To do everything but the last point on your list, you just need to run the text through a POS tagger, filter out the categories that don't interest you (determiners, pronouns, etc.) and count the frequencies of the base forms of the words.</p>

<p>Here are some popular POS taggers:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/"">TreeTagger</a> (binary only: Linux, Solaris, OS-X)<br />
<a href=""http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/GENIA/tagger/"">GENIA Tagger</a> (C++: compile your self)<br />
<a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml"">Stanford POS Tagger</a> (Java)  </p>

<p>To do the last thing on your list, you need more than just word-level information. An easy way to start is by counting <em>sequences</em> <em>of</em> <em>words</em> rather than just words themselves. These are called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram"">n-grams</a>. A good place to start is <a href=""http://people.sslmit.unibo.it/~baroni/compling04/UnixforPoets.pdf"">UNIX for Poets</a>. If you are willing to invest in a book on NLP, I would recommend <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0262133601"">Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib2, string
&gt;&gt;&gt; devilsdict = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.gutenberg.org/files/972/972.txt').read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; workinglist = devilsdict.split()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cleanlist = [item.strip(string.punctuation) for item in workinglist]
&gt;&gt;&gt; results = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; skip = {'a':'', 'the':'', 'an':''}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in cleanlist:
      if item not in skip:
        try:
          results[item] += 1
        except KeyError:
          results[item] = 1

&gt;&gt;&gt; results
{'': 17, 'writings': 3, 'foul': 1, 'Sugar': 1, 'four': 8, 'Does': 1, ""friend's"": 1, 'hanging': 4, 'Until': 1, 'marching': 2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>The first line just gets libraries that help with parts of the problem, as in the second line, where urllib2 downloads a copy of Ambrose Bierce's ""Devil's Dictionary""  The next lines make a list of all the words in the text, without punctuation.  Then you create a hash table, which in this case is like a list of unique words associated with a number.  The for loop goes over each word in the Bierce book, if there is already a record of that word in the table, each new occurrence adds one to the value associated with that word in the table; if the word hasn't appeared yet, it gets added to the table, with a value of 1 (meaning one occurrence.)  For the cases you are talking about, you would want to pay much more attention to detail, for example using capitalization to help identify proper nouns only in the middle of sentences, etc., this is very rough but expresses the concept.</p>

<p>To get into the stemming and pluralization stuff, experiment, then look into 3rd party work, I have enjoyed parts of the NLTK, which is an academic open source project, also in python.</p>

<p><em>Statisticians have devised several methods for detecting outliers. All the methods first quantify how far the outlier is from the other values. This can be the difference between the outlier and the mean of all points, the difference between the outlier and the mean of the remaining values, or the difference between the outlier and the next closest value. Next, standardize this value by dividing by some measure of scatter, such as the SD of all values, the SD of the remaining values, or the range of the data. Finally, compute a P value answering this question: If all the values were really sampled from a Gaussian population, what is the chance of randomly obtaining an outlier so far from the other values? If the P value is small, you conclude that the deviation of the outlier from the other values is statistically significant.</em> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>how much effort are you willing to put into this?</p></li>
<li><p>could some answers genuinely differ by +/-20% or whatever test you invent? so will there always be need for some human intervention?</p></li>
<li><p>and to invent a relevant test I'd need to know far more about the subject matter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That being said the following are possible alternatives.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A simple test against the previous value (or mean/mode of previous 10 or 20 values) would be straight forward to implement</p></li>
<li><p>The next level of complexity would involve some statistical measurement of all values (or previous x values, or values of the last 3 months), a normal or Gaussian distribution would enable you to give each value a degree of certainty as to it being a mistake vs. accurate.  This degree of certainty would typically be expressed as a percentage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function</a> there are adequate links from these pages to help in programming these, also depending on the language you're using there are likely to be functions and/or plugins available to help with this</p>

<ul>
<li>A more advanced method could be to have some sort of learning algorithm that could take other parameters into account (on top of the last x values) a learning algorithm could take the product type or manufacturer into account, for instance. Or even monitor the time of day or the user that has entered the figure.  This options seems way over the top for what you need however, it would require a lot of work to code it and also to train the learning algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the second option is the correct one for you. Using standard deviation (a lot of languages contain a function for this) may be a simpler alternative, this is simply a measure of how far the value has deviated from the mean of x previous values, I'd put the standard deviation option somewhere between option 1 and 2</p>

<p>If I try deleting or disabling breakpoints via another project, the action sometimes doesn't take effect, even though the debugger indicates that it has. So I will find myself breaking on disabled breakpoints, or on a (now invisible) breakpoint that I removed earlier.</p>

It really depends on what value you want out of the plot.  </p>

<p>If you are really concerned with the true max and true of a day's prices, then you have to deal with the outliers as outliers, and properly exclude them, probably using one of the outlier tests previously proposed ( data point is x% more than next point, or the last n points, or more than 5 standard deviations away from the daily mean).  Another approach is to view what happens after the outlier.  If it is an outlier, then it will have a sharp upturn followed by a sharp downturn.  </p>

<p>If however you care about overall trend, plotting daily trimmed mean, median, 5% and 95% percentiles will portray history well.  </p>

<p>Choose your display methods and how much outlier detection you need to do <em>based on the analysis question</em>.  If you care about medians or percentiles, they're probably irrelevant.</p>

92250,6112,2008-09-18T12:54:04Z,7440,16,"<p>I'm a huge fan of Selenium. Saying 'unit-testing your web ui' isn't exactly accurate as some of the comments have mentioned. However, I do find Selenium to be incredibly useful for performing those sort of acceptance and sanity tests on the UI.</p>

<p>A good way to get started is using Selenium IDE as part of your development. Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time. (Instead of having to manually go through the UI to get to the point where you can test whatever you're working on, just hit a button and Selenium IDE will take care of that for you. It's a terrific time-saver!)</p>

<p>Most of my major use case scenarios have Selenium RC tests to back them up. You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality. They're quick to write (especially if you implement common methods for things like logging in or setting up your test cases), quick to run, and provide a very tight feedback loop. In those senses Selenium RC tests are very <em>similar</em> to unit-tests.</p>

<p>I think, like anything else, if you put the effort into properly learning a test tool (eg, Selenium), your effort will pay off in spades. You mention that your company already uses Selenium to do UI testing. This is great. Work with it. If you find Selenium hard to use, or confusing, stick with it. The learning curve really isn't all that steep once you learn the API a little bit.</p>

<p>If I'm working on a web app, its rare for me to write a significant amount of code without Selenium RC tests to back it up. That's how effective I find Selenium. :) (Hopefully that'll answer your question..)</p>

92367,10292,2008-09-18T13:08:58Z,72240,3,"<p>The way I've accomplished something similar in the past is by using direct binding ports in the orchestrations and letting the MsgBox do the dirty work for me. Basically, it goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the callable orchestrations use a direct-bound port attached to your activating receive shape.</li>
<li>Set up a filter expression on your activating receive shape with a custom context-based property and set it equal to a value that uniquely identifies the orchestration (such as the orchestration name or whatever)</li>
<li>In the calling orchestration, create the message you'll want to use to fire the new orchestration. In that message, set your custom context property to the value that matches the filter used in the specific orchestration you want to fire.</li>
<li>Send the message through a direct-bound send port so that it gets sent to the MsgBox directly and the Pub/Sub mechanisms in BizTalk will take care of the rest.</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing to watch out in step 4: To have this work correctly, you will need to create a new Correlation Set type that includes your custom context property, and then make sure that the direct-bound send port ""follows"" the correlation set on the send. Otherwise, the custom property will only be written (and not promoted) to the msg context and the routing will fail.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

In Rails, you essentially start by defining your tables (with field names and their specifics). Then ActiveRecord will map them to Ruby classes or models.<br />
In Grails, it's the reverse: you start by defining your models (Groovy classes) and when you hit run, GORM (Grails ActiveRecord equivalent) will create the related database and tables (or update them). Which may also be why you don't have the concept of 'migrations' in Grails (although I think it will come in some future release).<br />
I don't know if one is better than the other. I guess it depends on your context.</p>

92959,13179,2008-09-18T14:19:13Z,92860,5,"<p>You would want to create an event on the control that is subscribed to in the parent. See <a href=""http://www.odetocode.com/code/94.aspx"">OdeToCode</a> for an example.</p>

<p>Here is the article for longevity sake:</p>

<p>Some user controls are entirely self contained, for example, a user control displaying current stock quotes does not need to interact with any other content on the page. Other user controls will contain buttons to post back. Although it is possible to subscribe to the button click event from the containing page, doing so would break some of the object oriented rules of encapsulation. A better idea is to publish an event in the user control to allow any interested parties to handle the event.</p>

<p>This technique is commonly referred to as âevent bubblingâ since the event can continue to pass through layers, starting at the bottom (the user control) and perhaps reaching the top level (the page) like a bubble moving up a champagne glass.</p>

<p>For starters, letâs create a user control with a button attached.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""c#"" AutoEventWireup=""false"" 
    Codebehind=""WebUserControl1.ascx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""aspnet.eventbubble.WebUserControl1"" 
    TargetSchema=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/intellisense/ie5""
%&gt;
&lt;asp:Panel id=""Panel1"" runat=""server"" Width=""128px"" Height=""96px""&gt;
    WebUserControl1 
    &lt;asp:Button id=""Button1"" Text=""Button"" runat=""server""/&gt;
&lt;/asp:Panel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The code behind for the user control looks like the following.</p>

<pre><code>public class WebUserControl1 : System.Web.UI.UserControl
{
   protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button Button1;
   protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Panel Panel1;

   private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
   {
      Response.Write(""WebUserControl1 :: Page_Load &lt;BR&gt;"");
   }

   private void Button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
   {
      Response.Write(""WebUserControl1 :: Begin Button1_Click &lt;BR&gt;"");
      OnBubbleClick(e);
      Response.Write(""WebUserControl1 :: End Button1_Click &lt;BR&gt;"");
   }

   public event EventHandler BubbleClick;

   protected void OnBubbleClick(EventArgs e)
   {
      if(BubbleClick != null)
      {
         BubbleClick(this, e);
      }
   }           

   #region Web Form Designer generated code
   override protected void OnInit(EventArgs e)
   {
      InitializeComponent();
      base.OnInit(e);
   }

   private void InitializeComponent()
   {
      this.Button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.Button1_Click);
      this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Page_Load);

   }
   #endregion

}
</code></pre>

<p>The user control specifies a public event (BubbleClick) which declares a delegate. Anyone interested in the BubbleClick event can add an EventHandler method to execute when the event fires â just like the user control adds an EventHandler for when the Button fires the Click event.</p>

<p>In the OnBubbleClick event, we first check to see if anyone has attached to the event (BubbleClick != null), we can then invoke all the event handling methods by calling BubbleClick, passing through the EventArgs parameter and setting the user control (this) as the event sender. Notice we are also using Response.Write to follow the flow of execution.</p>

<p>An ASPX page can now put the user control to work.</p>

<p>As soon as you take a full backup of the database, and the database is not using the Simple recovery model, SQL Server keeps a complete record of all transactions ever performed on the database. It does this so that in the event of a catastrophic failure where you lose the data file, you can restore to the point of failure by backing up the log and, once you have restored an old data backup, restore the log to replay the lost transactions.</p>

<p>To prevent this building up, you must back up the transaction log. Or, you can break the chain at the current point using the <code>TRUNCATE_ONLY</code> or <code>NO_LOG</code> options of BACKUP LOG.</p>

<p>If you don't need this feature, set the recovery model to Simple.</p>

<p>For the first case, you can use the <a href=""http://mono-project.com/MoMA"">Mono Migration Analyzer tool</a> (Moma) to evaluate how far your application is from running on Mono.  If the evaluation comes back with flying colors, you should start on your testing and QA and get ready to ship.</p>

<p>If your evaluation comes back with a report highlighting features that are missing or differ significantly in their semantics in Mono you will have to evaluate whether the code can be adapted, rewritten or in the worst case whether your application can work with reduced functionality.      </p>

<p>According to our Moma statistics based on user submissions (this is from memory) about 50% of the applications work out of the box, about 25% require about a week worth of work (refactoring, adapting) another 15% require a serious commitment to redo chunks of your code, and the rest is just not worth bothering porting since they are so incredibly tied to Win32.   At that point, either you start from zero, or a business decision will drive the effort to make your code portable, but we are talking months worth of work (at least from the reports we have).</p>

<p>If you are starting from scratch, the situation is a lot simpler, because you will only be using the APIs that are present in Mono.   As long as you stay with the supported stack (which is pretty much .NET 2.0, plus all the core upgrades in 3.5 including LINQ and System.Core, plus any of the Mono cross-platform APIs) you will be fine.  </p>

<p>Every once in a while you might run into bugs in Mono or limitations, and you might have to work around them, but that is not different than any other system.</p>

<p>As for portability: ASP.NET applications are the easier ones to port, as those have little to no dependencies on Win32 and you can even use SQL server or other popular databases (there are plenty of bundled database providers with Mono).   </p>

<p>Windows.Forms porting is sometimes trickier because developers like to escape the .NET sandbox and P/Invoke their brains out to configure things as useful as the changing the cursor blinking rate expressed as two bezier points encoded in BCD form in a wParam.   Or some junk like that.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>starting a MIDlet (a Java application for mobile phones) when the phone is switched on is tricky at best without coding a small Symbian OS C++ module that will start it for you. If you want to try anyway, look at the PushRegistry class in the MIDP specs
(http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/). The Content Handling API might provide some way to do it too (http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr211). When you are ready to give up, do it in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Backgrounding a MIDlet isn't hard. The phone's ""menu"" key will do it for you. Programatically, Canvas.setCurrent(null) has a good chance of working. Trying to trick the phone by providing a fully transparent GUI and not handling any keypad activity will absolutely not work. Creating and starting a separate Thread in the MIDlet should allow you to keep something running even after your overload of MIDlet.pauseApp() has been called by the application management system.</p></li>
<li><p>The real issue is that the MIDlet will not have any Inter Process Communication system unless you make one. The usual way of doing that is a loopback socket connection over which you transfer data. Not a nice or efficient way of simulating IPC. Sharing a RMS record can only be done from within the same MIDlet suite (you can package several MIDlets into the same .jar file), I think. The code to create a provider/consumer data flow over a file connection is even uglier and will raise security issues.</p></li>

94869,14382,2008-09-18T17:46:36Z,78450,2,"<p>Well, it looks as if I will be answering my own question.</p>

<p>First, the documentation flat out lies where it reads ""In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation.""  In the current release, the ""splitlast"" and ""splitfirst"" row indices break with the aforementioned TypeErrors on the TEXTCOLOR and BACKGROUND commnds.</p>

<p>My suspicion, based on reading the source code, is that only the tablestyle line commands (GRID, BOX, LINEABOVE, and LINEBELOW) are currently compatible with the 'splitfirst' and 'splitlast' row indices.  I suspect that all cell commands break with the aforementioned TypeErrors.</p>

<p>However, I was able to do what I wanted by subclassing the Table class and overriding the onSplit method.  Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>class XTable(Table):
    def onSplit(self, T, byRow=1):
        T.setStyle(TableStyle([
          ('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 1), (1, 1), colors.black)]))
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is apply the text color black to the first and second cell of the second row of each page.  (The first row is a header, repeated by the repeatRows parameter of the Table.)  More precisely, it is doing this to the first and second cell of each frame, but since I am using the SimpleDocTemplate, frames and pages are identical.</p>

The mechanism I have seen for them is to have the first call return an id (basically a transaction id) that is used in subsequent calls.

<p>It's not as short as the ""@hash{@array} = ..."" solutions, but those ones require the hash and array to already be defined somewhere else, whereas this one can take an anonymous array and return an anonymous hash.</p>

<p>What this does is take each element in the array and pair it up with a ""1"". When this list of (key, 1, key, 1, key 1) pairs get assigned to a hash, the odd-numbered ones become the hash's keys, and the even-numbered ones become the respective values.</p>

<p>The syntax here where you are referring to the hash with an <code>@</code> is a hash slice.  We're basically saying <code>$hash{$keys[0]}</code> AND <code>$hash{$keys[1]}</code> AND <code>$hash{$keys[2]}</code> ... is a list on the left hand side of the =, an lvalue, and we're assigning to that list, which actually goes into the hash and sets the values for all the named keys.  In this case, I only specified one value, so that value goes into <code>$hash{$keys[0]}</code>, and the other hash entries all auto-vivify (come to life) with undefined values.  [My original suggestion here was set the expression = 1, which would've set that one key to 1 and the others to <code>undef</code>.  I changed it for consistency, but as we'll see below, the exact values do not matter.]</p>

<p>When you realize that the lvalue, the expression on the left hand side of the =, is a list built out of the hash, then it'll start to make some sense why we're using that <code>@</code>.  [Except I think this will change in Perl 6.]</p>

<p>The idea here is that you are using the hash as a set.  What matters is not the value I am assigning; it's just the existence of the keys.  So what you want to do is not something like:</p>

<p>It's actually more efficient to just run an <code>exists</code> check than to bother with the value in the hash, although to me the important thing here is just the concept that you are representing a set just with the keys of the hash.  Also, somebody pointed out that by using <code>undef</code> as the value here, we will consume less storage space than we would assigning a value.  (And also generate less confusion, as the value does not matter, and my solution would assign a value only to the first element in the hash and leave the others <code>undef</code>, and some other solutions are turning cartwheels to build an array of values to go into the hash; completely wasted effort).</p>

95927,10703,2008-09-18T19:17:34Z,95890,27,"<p>The storage class specifier controls the <em>storage</em> and the <em>linkage</em> of your variables. These are two concepts that are different.
C specifies the following specifiers for variables: auto, extern, register, static.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong><br />
The storage duration determines how long your variable will live in ram.<br />
There are three types of storage duration: static, automatic and dynamic.</p>

<p><em>static</em><br />
If your variable is declared at file scope, or with an extern or static specifier, it will have static storage. The variable will exist for as long as the program is executing. No execution time is spent to create these variables.</p>

<p><em>automatic</em><br />
If the variable is declared in a function, but <strong>without</strong> the extern or static specifier, it has automatic storage. The variable will exist only while you are executing the function.  Once you return, the variable no longer exist.  Automatic storage is typically done on the stack.  It is a very fast operation to create these variables (simply increment the stack pointer by the size).</p>

<p><em>dynamic</em><br />
If you use malloc (or new in C++) you are using dynamic storage.  This storage will exist until you call free (or delete). This is the most expensive way to create storage, as the system must manage allocation and deallocation dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>Linkage</strong><br />
Linkage specifies who can see and reference the variable. There are three types of linkage: internal linkage, external linkage and no linkage.</p>

<p><em>no linkage</em><br />
This variable is only visible where it was declared. Typically applies to variables declared in a function.</p>

<p><em>internal linkage</em><br />
This variable will be visible to all the functions within the file (called a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28160/multiple-classes-in-a-header-file-vs-a-single-header-file-per-class"">translation unit</a>), but other files will not know it exists.</p>

<p><em>external linkage</em><br />
The variable will be visible to other translation units.  These are often thought of as ""global variables"".</p>

<p>Here is a table describing the storage and linkage characteristics based on the specifiers</p>

<pre>
  Storage Class   Function            File 
  Specifier        Scope              Scope

 extern          static            static
                 external linkage  external linkage

 static          static            static
                 no linkage        internal linkage

  auto           automatic         invalid

For example, variables defined in functions are usually saved on the stack, which means that it will be lost after the function returns. Using the ""static"" keyword, you can force the compiler to put the variable in the data segment in memory, making the variables content persistent between calls to that function. The ""register"" keyword will cause the compiler to try as hard as possible to put the variable in a CPU register, useful for counters in loops etc. However, it's not guaranteed that it's actually in a register after all.</p>

<p>However, if you'd like users to be able to persist their carts, then the database option is better.  This way, a user who is logged in will have their cart saved across sessions (so when they come back to the site and login, their cart will be restored).</p>

<p>You could also use a combination of the two.  Users who come to the site use the session-based cart by default.  When they log in, all items are moved from the session-based cart to a database-based cart, and any subsequent cart activity is applied directly to the database.</p>

While a cookie could ostensibly be an equal place to store things, if you consider security and data size, keeping as much data on the server as possible becomes a good thing.</p>

<p>For example, in a public terminal setting, would it be OK for someone to look at the contents of the cookie and see the list? If so, cookie's fine; if not, you'll just want an ID that links the user to the data. Doing that would also allow you to ensure the user is authenticated to the site in order to get to that data rather than storing everything on the machine - they'd need some form of credentials <em>as well as</em> the session identifier.</p>

<p>From a size perspective, sure, you're not going to be too concerned about a 4K cookie or something for a browser/broadband user, but if one of your targets is to allow a mobile phone or BlackBerry (not on 3G) to connect and have a snappy experience (and not get billed for the data), minimizing the amount of data getting passed to the client will be key.</p>

<p>The server storage also gives you some flexibility mentioned in some of the other answers - the user can save their cart on one machine and resume working with it on another; you can tie the cart to some form of credentials (rather than a transient session) and persist the cart long after the user has cleared their cookies; you get a little more in the way of fault tolerance - if the user's browser crashes, the site still has the data safe and sound.</p>

<p>If fault tolerance is important, you'll need some sort of persistent store like a database. If not, in application memory is probably fine, but you'll lose data if the app restarts. If you're in a farm environment, the store has to be centrally accessible, so you're again looking at a database.</p>

<p>Whether you choose to key by transient session or by credentials is going to depend on whether the users can save their data and come back later to get it. Transient session will eventually get cleaned up as ""abandoned,"" and maybe that's OK. Tying to a user profile will let the user keep their data and explicitly abandon it. Either way, I'd make use of some sort of backing store like a database for fault tolerance and central accessibility. (Or maybe I'm overengineering the solution?)</p>

<p>Click on Grocery Checklist to open the window. It does use ASPX, but only to manage the JS references placed on the page. The rest is done via AJAX using web services.</p>

<p>Previously I built an ASP.NET 2.0 site for a commerce site which used anon/auth cookies automatically. Each provides you with a GUID value which you can use to identify a user which is then associated with data in your database. I wanted the auth cookies so a user could move to different computers; work, home, etc. I avoided using the Profile fields to hold onto a complex ShoppingBasket object which was popular during the time in all the ASP.NET 2.0 books. I did not want to deal with ""magic"" serialization issues as the data structure changed over time. I prefer to manage db schema changes with update/alter scripts synced with software changes.</p>

<p>With the anon/auth cookies identifying the user on the client you can use the ASP.NET AJAX client-side to call the authentication web services using the JS proxies that are provided for you as a part of ASP.NET. You need to implement the Membership API to at least authenticate the user. The rest of the provider implementation can throw a NotImplementedException safely. You can then use your own custom ASMX web services via AJAX (see ScriptReference attribute) and update the pages with server-side data. You can completely do away with ASPX pages and just use static HTML/CSS/JS if you like.</p>

<p>The one big caveat is memory leaks in JS. Staying on the same page a long time increases your potential issue with memory leaks. It is a risk you can minimize by testing for long sessions and using tools like Firebug and others to look for memory leaks. Use the JS Lint tool as well as it will help identify major problems as you go.</p>

<p>For more heavyweight classes that you want to make sure are not copied (say for example a large bitmap image) then it is a good idea to pass stuff like that around as a reference parameter which then gets filled in, just to make absolutely sure that there won't be any temporary objects created.</p>

<p>For example if you want to monitor a process:</p>

<ul>
<li>for 1 hour : I would use 1 second intervals (this will generate 60*60 samples)</li>
<li>for 1 day : I would use 30 second intervals (this will generate 2*60*24 samples)</li>
<li>for 1 week : I would use 1 minute intervals (this will generate 60*24*7 samples)</li>
</ul>

<p>With these sampling intervals Perfmon should have no problem generating a nice graphical output of your counters.</p>

97698,15154,2008-09-18T22:37:04Z,93930,10,"<p>I've used Tkinter and wxPython.  Tkinter is quite basic, and doesn't use native widgets.  This means that Tkinter applications will look the same on any platform â this might sound appealing, but in practice, it means they look ugly on any platform :-/  Nevertheless, it's pretty easy to use.  I found <a href=""http://www.ferg.org/thinking_in_tkinter/index.html"">Thinking in Tkinter</a> very helpful when I was learning, because I'd never done any GUI programming before.  If things like frames and layout algorithms and buttons and bindings are familiar to you, though, you can skip that step.</p>

<p>You can augment Tkinter with Tix (but be warned, Tix doesn't play well with py2exe).  Also check out Python Megawidgets, which builds some more advanced controls using the Tkinter basics.</p>

<p>Finally, Tkinter plays nice with the shell: you can start the interpreter, do things like 'import tkinter' 'tk = tkinter.Tk()' etc. and build your GUI interactively (and it will be responsive).  (I think this doesn't work if you use IDLE, though)</p>

<p>wxPython is much better looking, and ships with a much greater range of controls.  It's cross-platform (though it seems a bit finicky on my Mac) and uses native controls on each platform.  It's a bit confusing, though.  It also ships with a demo application that shows off most of its features, and provides a test-bed for you to experiment.  Some specific thoughts on wxPython:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are three (?) different ways to lay widgets out.  Ignore two of them; just use Sizers.  And even then, you can do just about any layout using only BoxSizer and GridBagSizer.</li>
<li>All wx widgets have IDs.  You don't need to care what the IDs are, but in the old days (I think) you did need to know, so some old code will be littered with explicit ID assignments.  And most demo code will have -1 everywhere as the ID parameter (despite the fact that the methods all have ID as a keyword parameter that defaults to -1 anyway).</li>
<li>Make sure you get the standard wxWidgets docs as well as the wxPython Demo â you need them both.</li>
<li>If you want to use wxPython with py2exe and you want it to look good on Windows XP, you need a bit of trickery in your setup.py.  See <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2004-June/268126.html"">here</a></li>

<ol>
<li>IIS 7.0 is much more robust host and it comes with numerous features that make debugging easy. Failed requests tracing, worker process recycling, process orphaning  to name a few.</li>
<li>IIS 7.0 gives you more option to specify what should happen with the worker process in certain circumstances. </li>
<li>If you host your service under IIS it doesn't have a worker process assigned to it until the very first request. This is something that was a desired behaviour from my perspective but it might be different in your case. Windows Service gives you the ability to start your service in a more deterministic way.</li>
<li>From my experience WAS itself doesn't provide increased reliability. It's biggest advantage is that it exposes the richness of IIS to applications that use protocols different than HTTP. By different I mean: TCP, named pipes and MSMQ.</li>
<li>The only disadvantage of using WAS that I'm aware of is that the address your service is exposed at needs to be compliant with some sort of pattern. How it looks like in case of MSMQ is described <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2008/07/12/msmq-wcf-and-iis-getting-them-to-play-nice-part-1.aspx"">here</a></li>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Here is a little example that does it wrong twice:</p>

<p>(assume 32 bit ints and little endian)</p>

{
  unsigned int temp = *(unsigned int *)&amp;a;
  temp &amp;= 0x7fffffff;
  return *(float *)&amp;temp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That code tries to get the absolute value of a float by bit-twiddling with the sign bit directly in the representation of a float.</p>

<p>However, the result of creating a pointer to an object by casting from one type to another is not valid C. The compiler may assume that pointers to different types don't point to the same chunk of memory. This is true for all kind of pointers except void* and char* (sign-ness does not matter). </p>

<p>In the case above I do that twice. Once to get an int-alias for the float a, and once to convert the value back to float. </p>

<p>There are three valid ways to do the same.</p>

<p>Use a char or void pointer during the cast. These always alias to anything, so they are safe.</p>

<pre><code>float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  float temp_float = a;
  // valid, because it's a char pointer. These are special.
  unsigned char * temp = (unsigned char *)&amp;temp_float;
  temp[3] &amp;= 0x7f;
  return temp_float;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Use memcopy. Memcpy takes void pointers, so it will force aliasing as well. </p>

<pre><code>float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  int i;
  float result;
  memcpy (&amp;i, &amp;a, sizeof (int));
  i &amp;= 0x7fffffff;
  memcpy (&amp;result, &amp;i, sizeof (int));
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The third valid way: use unions. This is explicitly <strong>not undefined since C99:</strong></p>

<pre><code>float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  union 
  {
     unsigned int i;
     float f;

  cast_helper.f = a;

<pre><code>// what does this do?

<p>To answer some comments, it is undefined behaviour according to the standard. Seeing this, the compiler is allowed to do anything up to and including format your hard drive.
See for example <a href=""http://www.digitalmars.com/pnews/read.php?server=news.digitalmars.com&amp;group=digitalmars.D&amp;artnum=47343"">this comment here</a>. The point is not that you can see there is a possible reasonable expectation of some behaviour. Because of the C++ standard and the way the sequence points are defined, this line of code is actually undefined behaviour.</p>

<p>For example, if we had <code>x = 1</code> before the line above, then what would the valid result be afterwards? Someone commented that it should be </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>x is incremented by 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so we should see x == 2 afterwards. However this is not actually true, you will find some compilers that have x == 1 afterwards, or maybe even x == 3. You would have to look closely at the generated assembly to see why this might be, but the differences are due to the underlying problem. Essentially, I think this is because the compiler is allowed to evaluate the two assignments statements in any order it likes, so it could do the <code>x++</code> first, or the <code>x =</code> first.</p>
